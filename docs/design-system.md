# NerfChess Design System

The single visual and interaction contract for every route. Written during the 2026-07 full-product redesign. Any page that deviates from this document is wrong, and either the page or this document must change in the same PR.

## 1. Identity pillars (keep, never dilute)

- Flat neutral dark surfaces, Lichess's: `#161512` page, `#262421` box, `#302e2c` raised, `#404040` borders. No page wash, no grain, no atmosphere layer. The light palette is the same ladder in reverse (`#edebe9` / `#ffffff` / `#f7f6f5` / `#d9d9d9`).
- Neutral grey text: `#bababa` body, `#cccccc` headings, `#8c8c8c` secondary, `#707070` muted, via `--paper` and `parchment-*`.
- One accent, Lichess blue `#3692e7` (hover `#4a9fee`), on white. It owns "act here": links, primary buttons, focus, selection. There is no accent-colour setting.
- Mode duality as content, not ornament: a surface that belongs to Buff or Nerf carries its mode hue on a border, a chip, or a label. Nothing else may use those hues, and they never appear as a decorative gradient or divider.
- Chess-piece artwork and the competitive-fantasy voice: pieces, sigils, and card tiers are the decoration. No stock illustration, no emoji as UI.
- Dramatic game effects that never cost readability: the board stays legible through every animation.

## 2. Color roles

| Role | Token | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Page | `ink-900` (`--bg-base`) | The only page background. Flat, no wash |
| Panel | `--surface-panel` (`.plate`) | Cards, rails, lists |
| Raised | `--surface-raise` (`.plate-raised`) | Menus, modals, hovered rows |
| Edge | `--edge` / `--edge-strong` | All hairlines. Never `white/10` alpha borders in new code |
| Body text | `parchment` 100-300 | Content |
| Muted text | `parchment-400` | Labels, captions. Floor: never below `parchment-500` |
| Act | `--accent` (`gold` token, Lichess blue) | Primary buttons, links, focus, selected |
| Highlight | `--sun` (muted brass) | Rank, reward, featured, celebration |
| Positive | `--pos` (`#629924`) | Success, rating up, "Live" |
| Danger | `oxblood` / `--accent-danger` (`#c0413b`) | Errors, resign, destructive |
| Buff identity | `mode.buff` / `buffGlow` | Buff-mode surfaces and chips only |
| Nerf identity | `mode.nerf` / `nerfGlow` | Nerf-mode surfaces and chips only |
| Tiers | `.tier-1..10` + `.tier-bg-*` | Card tiers everywhere, no exceptions |

Rules:
- No new colors. If a design wants a color not in this table, the design is wrong. Board and piece palettes are the one exception: they are the player's setting (`BOARD_THEMES` / `PIECE_THEMES`, defaulting to Lichess's brown board and cburnett pieces).
- Mode hues never mean success/failure. Positive/danger never brand a mode.
- One accent-colored primary action per view region. Everything else is quiet.

## 3. Typography

Faces are **roles, not fixed families**: `--font-display` for headings and numbers that matter, `--font-body` for content, `--font-mono` (JetBrains Mono, self-hosted) for ids, clocks, and coordinates. Both text roles resolve to Noto Sans, the face Lichess ships, so weight does the hierarchy. Never name a family directly in a component; use the role.

Scale: the fluid ramp `--step-0..5` only, on a 14px base. No ad-hoc `text-4xl` in new code. The ramp is tight on purpose: the largest step lands near 2.1rem and a page heading around 1.6rem, which is how Lichess sets type.

Hierarchy is weight + size + color, in that order. Never letter-spacing alone.

Minimum sizes (hard floor):
- Body and interactive text: 13px (`text-[13px]`) desktop, 14px mobile.
- Captions and labels: 12px. The 9-10px letterspaced-smallcaps pattern is retired sitewide, along with the `.smallcaps` / `.eyebrow` / `.kicker` utilities that carried it. A section label is a plain bold heading at the body size, not an uppercase tracked-out device.

Numbers that update (clocks, ratings, counts) always `tabular-nums`.

## 4. Spacing and density

- Base unit 4px. Panel padding: 12px compact, 16px default, 20px only for hero moments. The `p-2 px-3` plate default stays.
- Section rhythm on marketing/landing surfaces: `--rhythm-section`. App surfaces (lobby, game, TV) are dense: they are tools, not brochures.
- Density rule: a list row is 40-48px tall, a data table row 36-40px. Empty air is not hierarchy.
- Max content width 1200px app, 1100px reading. The board column caps at 720px.
- No giant empty sections. If a region can be empty, it gets a designed empty state (see 8) sized to its content, not to the viewport.
- **Progressive disclosure (2026-08 de-crowd pass).** A view region shows ONE primary thing; everything secondary folds behind a labeled disclosure (header-with-chevron toggle, `aria-expanded`, count chip) or an overflow menu. Tab sets answer exactly one question (the dock's You/Them, the lobby's Play/Watch) — histories and rarely-used editors are disclosures, not tabs. Deep links (`?tab=`) must keep working by mapping old values onto the new tab and auto-opening the right fold. Settings is the reference two-level drill-down: a sparse home of category cards (title + one-line blurb) opening focused sub-pages with a Back control, one level, never deeper. Collapsed rows carry their state as chips (Usable, Temp, Used) so folding never hides live status.

## 5. Surfaces and geometry

The whole site is flat boxes on a flat page. There is one box style, one radius pair, and no material.

- Geometry: **7px** on a box or panel, **3px** on a button, enforced by the global rules in `globals.css` (`[class*="rounded"]` and a `button, .btn, [role="button"]` override). True circles only for avatars and status dots. `npm run test:rounded` guards it.
- `.plate` is the only box: `background: var(--bg-panel)`, `1px solid var(--border-subtle)`, 7px radius, **no shadow**. Two plain variants exist and neither adds a shadow: `.plate-raised` (one rung lighter, for modals and menus) and `.plate-hover` (border and fill lift on hover, behind `hover: hover`). `.rail-panel` is the same box under a different name, kept because the in-game rail spells it.
- Elevation is lightness on the background ladder (`--bg-base` -> `--bg-panel` -> `--bg-raised`), never a drop shadow, never a glow, never `backdrop-blur`.
- Retired in the 2026-09 flattening, and not to be reintroduced: `.dgn-slab`, `.dgn-rivets`, `.torch-pool`, `.rune-divider`, `.mode-seam`, `.seam-edge-b`, `.mode-field`, `.corner-cut`, `.plate-warm`, `.gilt`, `.masthead`, `.sec-title`, `.kicker`, and the whole dungeon lobby/menu/gate stylesheet set. A new surface reuses `.plate`; it does not invent a parallel treatment.
- Glow is not a state and no longer an event either: selection and urgency are carried by the accent border, the accent fill, and weight.

## 6. Motion

Vocabulary: `--ease-out` for entrances and hovers, `--ease-io` for movement between states, `--ease-spring` only for reveal, seal, and victory. Durations `--dur-1..3` (120/200/320ms); anything longer is a choreographed game effect with its own budget (see the passive effect spec).

Rules:
- Respect `data-anim` (off/fast) and `prefers-reduced-motion` in every new animation, including game effects. Reduced motion means a short fade plus a persistent indicator, never zero feedback.
- Animate `transform` and `opacity` only, except sanctioned board effects.
- Nothing loops forever except the three ambient effects (flicker, sigil, bob) and clock urgency.
- An animation may never delay authoritative state or block input after state resolves.

## 7. Components

- Buttons: use **`<Button>` / `<LinkButton>`** from `src/components/ui/Button.tsx`. There are exactly three tones:

  | Tone | Look | Use |
  |---|---|---|
  | `primary` | solid accent fill, white label | one per view region |
  | `default` | `--bg-raised` fill, hairline border, slightly lighter on hover | everything else |
  | `danger` | the same shape carrying red | Resign, Delete, Leave, Decline, Remove |

  The older names still compile and map onto those three (`leaf`/`cta`/`gold` -> primary, `ghost`/`quiet`/`glass`/`slab` -> default), so no call-site had to be rewritten. The `--btn-*` material contract is gone: there is no rim, top light, floor, glint, or face layer to author. `loading` gives the busy state; `.press` is on by default. Min touch target 44x44 mobile, 36px desktop. `npm run test:buttons` reports the remaining bespoke call sites.
- Tabs: underline style (current), 13px+ label, active = parchment-50 + accent underline, inactive = parchment-300. Same component on every route.
- Chips/badges: 12px, `.tier-bg-*` for tiers, mode chips for Buff/Nerf, `LIVE` badge = pos dot + label.
- Lists and tables: row hover `--surface-hover`, dividers `--edge`, never zebra. Rank/rating right-aligned tabular.
- Player identity unit: avatar (or piece glyph) + name + rating (+ provisional "?") + badges. One shared component, used by lobby rows, TV, game HUD, leaderboard, profiles, community.
- Forms: inputs on `ink-900/60`, `--edge` border, accent focus ring `focus-visible:outline-2 outline-offset-2`.

## 8. System states (every async surface implements all five)

1. Loading: skeleton in the exact final geometry (board skeleton pattern). Never spinners taller than 24px, never full-page spinners.
2. Empty: one sentence of what would be here + one action to change that. Sized to content. Piece-glyph accent, not sad-face illustration.
3. Error: what failed in plain words + Retry + a way out (Back to lobby). Never a dead end.
4. Disconnected/reconnecting: the existing ConnectionBanner pattern everywhere; board dims 20% but stays visible; never unmount live state during reconnect.
5. Recovered: silent when fast (<2s), single toast when slow. Never modal.

## 9. Navigation

- Top nav: Play, Watch, Community, Leaderboard, Rules + search, inbox, alerts, identity. Active route always marked. Identical on every page including game and TV (game pages may compact it, never replace it).
- Footer only on marketing/reading pages, never on app surfaces.
- Every player name links to `/u/[username]`. Every game id links to `/game/[id]`. Every card name links to its codex page. No dead nouns.
- Mobile: bottom action bar on app surfaces (lobby quick match, game actions), bottom sheets for pickers, drawers for rails. Breakpoints: rails stack below `sm` (640), game rail becomes bottom section below `md`.

## 10. Accessibility

- AA contrast minimum for text and interactive glyphs (parchment-400 on panel is the floor; check anything dimmer).
- Focus visible on everything interactive (accent 2px outline, 2px offset).
- All icon-only buttons carry `aria-label`. Status changes announce via `role="status"` / `aria-live="polite"` (existing patterns extend).
- Keyboard: move-list scrubbing with arrow keys, tab order follows visual order, modals trap focus and close on Escape.
- Hit areas: 44px mobile, and interactive rows are fully clickable, not just their text.

## 11. Voice

- Sentence case everywhere, including buttons ("Find a match", not "FIND A MATCH"). Allcaps survive only in the LIVE badge.
- Copy is confident and concrete: "A draft lands every 5 moves", never marketing fluff.
- Numbers are shown, not narrated: "312 online", not "lots of players online".

## 12. Route-level contracts

Every route redesign must produce: desktop + mobile screenshots, all five system states implemented, zero new colors, zero sub-12px text, linked player names, and a pass through this checklist recorded in the PR description.
