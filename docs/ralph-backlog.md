# Ralph backlog

The standing work list for the continuous improvement loop. This file is the
loop's memory: a round picks the next unstarted items, does them, and updates
the status here in the same commit. A later session that knows nothing about
this one can read this file and carry on.

Status values: `TODO`, `WIP`, `DONE`, `DROPPED` (with a reason).
Sizes: XS under an hour, S a round, M two or three rounds, L a night.

Working rules for every round, non-negotiable:

- `docs/design-system.md` and `docs/DESIGN.md` are the contract. No new colours,
  no shadows, no glow, no backdrop blur, 7px on boxes and 3px on buttons, 13px
  text floor, transform and opacity only, `--ease-*` and `--dur-1..3`.
- Every animation respects `data-anim` (off/fast) and `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- No em dashes in user-visible text.
- Nothing is pushed on a red guard. `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and the
  guards relevant to what changed, plus `npm run build` before a push.
- `./node_modules/.bin/tsx`, never `npx -y tsx` (parallel npx installs race and
  corrupt the cache).
- **Parallelism has a hard ceiling here, and it is lower than it looks.** The
  box has 4 cores. `tsc --noEmit` and `eslint .` each walk 649 files across
  340k lines (one of them 1.06 MB), and each run costs about 10 to 17 percent
  of memory. Round 0 ran eight workers at once, they all reached their verify
  step together, and load average hit 87: every command including `pkill`
  started timing out. Three or four concurrent workers is the real limit, and
  a worker should lint and typecheck the files it touched rather than the
  whole repo, with one full-repo pass done once at integration time.
- Long simulations run niced and get suspended (`pkill -STOP`) while workers
  verify, then resumed. `sim-card-winrate.ts` flushes every 10 cards and
  resumes from its own shard file, so stopping it never costs more than the
  current batch.
- **`scripts/dev-supervisor.sh` keeps `next dev` alive; run it for any long
  session.** The dev server has died twice in two different ways, and both times
  the failure was invisible to whatever was using it: a browser test reads a
  dead port as a broken page rather than a missing server, which is a bad hour
  to spend. The supervisor polls, checks twice ten seconds apart (a single
  failed request during a slow first compile is not a dead server), restarts,
  and prints one line only when it has actually done something.
- **Restart `next dev` between rounds.** It leaks: after about seven hours of
  HMR and route compiles the dev server sat at **9.1 GB resident**, which is 57
  percent of the box on its own. That single process was the whole of a
  near-OOM in round 7 (1.1 GB available, load average 74); killing it took
  available memory from 1.1 GB to 12.9 GB in three seconds, before anything
  else was touched. Check `ps -eo rss,args --sort=-rss | head` before blaming
  the workers. The second way it dies is a Turbopack abort: "an internal panic
  occurred outside the per-task panic boundary" out of
  `turbo-tasks-backend/.../operation/mod.rs`, which is a Next bug rather than
  anything in this repo and kills the process outright.
- When memory does get tight, `pkill` and `pkill -9` themselves fail or return
  144 under load, and a second `pgrep` will show the processes still alive.
  `pgrep -f pat | xargs -r kill -9` works where `pkill -f pat` does not.
- **Close a row in the same commit as the work, and keep the line numbers out
  of the claim.** Round 7 sent a worker at six items and four of them (C10,
  C19, E10, E11) had already been done in rounds 1 and 2 while the rows still
  read TODO with round-0 line numbers that no longer pointed at anything. It
  spent most of its run proving that working code works. A row's line numbers
  are evidence for when it was written and nothing else; re-measure before
  believing one.
- **Give a worker the widths AND the pointer types**, not the widths alone.
  Every touch-target defect found so far has been masked by some width query
  standing in for a pointer query, and a probe that only varies width
  reproduces the same blind spot it is meant to find.
- **A detector that reports hundreds of findings on one surface is usually
  wrong about that surface.** Every time the sweep's touch-target check has
  produced a big number it has been the check, not the site: 241 GlossaryText
  spans (the exemption tested `tagName === "A"`), 120 codex rows (the row was
  the target and the link inside it was reported), 108 settings switches (the
  hit area lives on an absolutely-positioned `::before`, which
  `getBoundingClientRect` does not see), 64 puzzle-board squares (a chess
  square at 360 is 42px because the board is 336px wide, and demanding 44
  would be demanding a board that does not fit), and the whole fine-pointer
  count. Read the top ten findings on the worst route before believing the
  total, and check the shape they share.

## Round log

| Round | What landed |
|---|---|
| 0 | Backlog created, Lichess parity study, stale rules copy fixed (guides described a slip gate the engine no longer has), modal focus trap |
| 1 | Material model, chess sound pass (found `tone()` ignoring the volume slider outright), board keyboard play, loading and error states 8 to 21 and 1 to 18, typography floor, contrast tokens, four dead components |
| 2 | Clock urgency scaled to the time control, running-separator blink, the new sound cues wired to their events, zen on analysis and TV and the replay, PGN on the replay |
| 3 | Surface ladder restored to its documented values, sentence case in the nav and settings menu plus `scripts/check-case.ts` to hold it, the material ladder applied (18 cards) and pinned as an invariant |
| 4 | Route sweep harness (48 routes, 6 widths, 3 themes, 828 cells, 13.5 min), touch targets fixed after it proved every rem-based one was 12.5 percent short, eight routes given the h1 they lacked |
| 5 | The bot now simulates a card's effect before choosing its targets, which fixes a blunder that was corrupting every win-rate measurement of every activated card; changelog caught up; sweep restarted |
| 6 | `amazon_army` root-caused: the search-depth hypothesis was measured and REFUTED, and the real defect is that `negamax` cannot see buff-granted moves below the root. `SearchStats` added to `pickAIMove`; `test:search-buffs` locks the defect. Plus the system-states round: the polled inbox was silent about a dead connection, and sub-13px interactive text went 312 to 151 |
| 7 | A6 confirmed independently from the win-rate data via the duration x grant-size interaction (4.5 sigma where predicted, 0.4 and 0.5 where predicted absent). The 26 affected cards quarantined from downward retiers. Ladder checked for contamination and cleared. The mobile flip button that measured 0 x 0, the last `role="lead"`, contrast tokens, touch-target shapes, `/settings` route |
| 8 | **A13: the search can see buff-granted moves now**, via a private cloned view (283 hooks audited: 0 RNG draws, 10 writing `inst.state`). It cost a ply at the 60ms floor and it REFUTED the round-7 mechanism: a paired A/B gives -0.9 +-3.6 pt where round 7 predicted 21. The draft went 39% to 31% of a session, and two parts of it were not slow but broken (glossary spans swallowing card clicks, a Reroll button for an action the engine refuses). Per-theme tier palette, 180/180 AA. Sub-12px sitewide 24 to 0. An eval bar that quantises to seven bands under a rule rather than claiming a number. Both parser holes closed, `KNOWN_MISREAD` empty. And every search budget turns out to be worth up to 2x what its caller asked for |
| 9 | **Search budgets mean what they say**: `negamax` hard-deadlines at the ask, decided by an experiment showing the old 2x headroom bought no depth at an equal wall ceiling, and 52 of 54 samples had been using it. The house bots were sized around that hidden multiplier and would have lost half a ply silently, so all 20 tiers and both ceilings doubled with them. `/game/[id]` could strand a viewer on "Connecting..." forever (30s, unhandled rejection; now 1926ms to a terminal state). The eval search moved to a worker. Three accessibility root causes: the card face stopped being a `<button>` (nested interactive 3-4 to 0), cards stopped announcing in caps, rarity chips 9 of 12 failing combinations to 0. The parser reads delayed removal (9 cards, 16 moved of 1665, 0 unintended). The 13px floor by shape: 114 unique elements to 38 across 15 routes |

---

## A. Balance: the material ladder

The named problem: the tier ladder is sublinear in material, so a card that
hands you 3 points is priced roughly where a card that hands you 1 point is.
`wa_conjure_bishop` (permanent unconditional bishop) sits at tier 3, below
`split_bishop` and `bn4_cathedral_choir` which do the same thing at tier 4.
`bn4_care_package` at tier 3 measures +41.7 win-rate points, the same band as
tier 6 and 7 cards. There is no invariant covering spawn or revival material,
which is why nothing caught it.

| # | Item | Size | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | `scripts/material-model.ts`: score every active card for effective material, fit a tier floor against measured win rate, report violations | M | DONE (round 1) |
| A2 | Full-library win-rate sweep, 3 niced shards, `--games 10`, writing `docs/card-winrate.shard{0,1,2}.json` | L | **STALE AGAIN as of round 8.** A13 changed how the bot searches, so every row measured before it is a measurement of a different engine, exactly as in round 5 when the activation policy changed. Mixing the two is worse than either alone. Restart from zero against the new search and treat `docs/search-bias.json` and the A6 interaction as historical: they describe the blind search, which no longer exists. Suspend with `pkill -STOP -f sim-card-winrate` while workers verify, resume with `-CONT`; it flushes every 10 cards and resumes from its own shard file |
| A3 | Apply the retiers through `hand-audit.json` + `npm run gen:retiers` + `CARD_HISTORY` | M | DONE (round 2): 18 moved, 10 of the original 28 were parser misreads and are fixed or held out |
| A4 | Pin the material ladder as an invariant so a later blanket pass cannot undo it | S | DONE (round 2): section 1b of `scripts/test-balance-pass-2026-09.ts` |
| A8 | **The pocket discount is probably backwards.** Measured in round 7 and the answer is no. The whole family, not the one card that raised it: pocket cards sit at **+1.1pt** residual against their own tier (n=13), non-pocket material cards at **+7.3pt** (n=71), a difference of **-6.3 +-5.0pt, 1.3 sigma** in the OPPOSITE direction to the hypothesis, and unresolvable either way. `bn4_care_package` +41.7 is the top of a spread running down to `legendary_forge` -16.7; those two carry the same payload class and sit 58 points apart on 12 pairs each, which is the error bar, exactly as round 1 found for `legendary_forge` against `bodyguard`. The mechanical argument (a drop lands anywhere, dodges every nerf filter, breaks stalemate) may still be right and the sweep may simply not resolve 5%, but changing a multiplier on the largest number in a noisy column is the failure mode this model exists to avoid. Multiplier stays 0.95; reasoning rewritten in the model's header | M | DROPPED (not supported) |
| A9 | **Two parser holes, both closed (round 8), and `KNOWN_MISREAD` is now empty.** A REPLACEMENT ("X ... and Y returns **in its place**") is a transform written the long way round, so the card is worth the difference: `seance` **3.25 to 1.30**, which is its hand-checked value. A GLOSS is a later sentence re-describing the piece an earlier one already scored, and the tell is that one of the two terms carries the parser's own `best-of` mark, i.e. "this sentence says WHICH one": `wc_lost_and_found` **4.94 to 3.25**, which is what the engine actually revives (`['r','b','n','p'].find(revivable)` places one piece). Both are now pinned in `PARSE_EXPECTATIONS` rather than held out, which is the stronger statement: a hold-out says "we know this is wrong", a pin says "we know this is right". Proved narrow by diffing every card's M before and after: **exactly 2 of 1665 moved**, and they are the two. The replacement pass deliberately does nothing when the sentence names two candidate antecedents, on the same principle as the parser's existing `pending` logic | S | DONE |
| A5 | Rework, not just retier, cards that are cheap AND boring (pure "+3 material, no decision") | M | TODO |
| A6 | **`amazon_army` measured -25. The search could not see buff-granted moves below the root, and now it can.** The code defect was real, was root-caused in round 6, and was FIXED in round 8 (A13). What did not survive is the win-rate mechanism I attributed to it: see "the null" below. Pinned by `npm run test:search-buffs` | M | DONE |
| A13 | **Make `negamax` buff-aware.** DONE (round 8). `buildSearchBuffs` / `applySearchAugments` in `game.ts` and `genMoves` in `ai.ts`. The search runs against a PRIVATE VIEW (cloned instances, cloned match state, cloned captured pools and player slots), so an impure generator can mis-score a search and cannot reach the game. Expiry is modelled: the side to move at ply p has played `p >> 1` of its own moves, so per-ply instances carry pre-aged counters and drop out when they expire; charge-limited augments (133 of 283) carry a bit in a mask threaded down each line. Two `BuffApi`s per SEARCH, not per node; per node only `.board` is retargeted. Zero cost when no move-granting card is held, proved by identical node counts (10479 at medium/60ms, 523739 at hard/2000ms). With one held it costs a ply at the 60ms floor and a ply at hard, and the fixed-depth decomposition says why: nodes 1.61 to 1.65x, microseconds per node 0.99 to 1.06x, so essentially all of it is the genuinely wider tree and none is augment overhead | L | DONE |
| A7 | Work the `pending-review` backlog in `docs/card-audit.md`: 266 duplicate-signature, 211 near-duplicate, 90 dominated | L | TODO |
| A11 | **`queens_rampage` was a play-policy bug, not a tier problem.** FIXED (round 5) by `refineLastSquarePick` in `src/engine/game.ts`: the bot now re-picks a card's last square by simulating the activation on a detached copy of the game and scoring the resulting position, instead of ranking squares by the piece standing on them. Pinned by `npm run test:ai-activation`, which fails on two of three assertions without the fix | S | DONE |
| A12 | **Reframed in round 8: this is not a missing second axis, it is a parser blind spot.** The row used to say the model prices material and is blind to everything else, so the twelve cards measuring above +30 at M=0 needed a second model. Reading all EIGHTEEN of them against their descriptions says otherwise: **fourteen are material the parser cannot read**, and only four are genuinely non-material. Unparsed material: `hw3_doomed_vow` +55 (an enemy piece is dragged off the board), `mass_mind_control` +55 (two enemy pieces defect, which is a double swing), `reality_warp` +50 (two of your pieces become queens, so +2x(9-value)), `bn4_ascension_small` +45.8 (a minor becomes a queen, +6), `hw3_time_bomb` +45 and `lightning_strike` +44.4 and `total_atomic` +33.3 and `atomic_captures` +31.8 and `detonation_field` +30 (all mass or conditional removal), `detonate` +44.4 (-1 pawn, +N adjacent), `smurf_account` +41.7 (a fresh ROOK drops in, and the effect category "capture-denial" is wrong too), `giants_maul` +41.7 (crush a minor or rook, then freeze), `bn4_endless_militia` +35 (three captured pawns return), `pay_to_win` +33.3 (a copy of a minor or rook into the pocket). Genuinely non-material, and the only four that would need a second axis: `mirror_of_souls` +50 (swap two pieces OF THE SAME KIND, so net zero material by construction and pure position), `dragon_pawn` +41.7 (a movement grant), `piece_parole` +40 (a shield plus a nerf suspension), `ballerina_cappuccina` +31.8 (a formation move, i.e. tempo). So the work is A14, not a second model | M | REFRAMED |
| A14 | **The parser now reads delayed and conditional removal.** DONE (round 9), 9 of the 14 unreadable-material cards fixed, coverage in the material categories **190/284 to 202/284**. The reconnaissance was right that they fail for different reasons: six of them, not one. `mass_mind_control` was failing on a QUALIFIER, not an anaphor ("of any type below **queen**" left `queen` in `mentions`, forming a second noun group, so the deliberate two-candidate guard fired); `lightning_strike` needed `ANAPHOR_NOUN` because its later clause does contain a noun ("each marked piece") and the `!hasNoun` test excluded it; `reality_warp` needed `become` as a transform bridge and a real count; `hw3_doomed_vow`, `giants_maul`, `smurf_account`, `total_atomic` and `detonation_field` were missing verbs, modifiers and repeat gates. **16 cards moved of 1665 and 0 were unintended**: 7 were not on the list and each was read against its buff before being kept, because the same fix that reads `reality_warp` also reads `twin_queens` and `philosophers_stone`. 15 new pins in `PARSE_EXPECTATIONS` (49/49 passing), every `why` citing the buff line rather than the card text. `KNOWN_MISREAD` has one row again, `bw2_alchemists_trade`, which now parses at 6 against a real 4 because the engine is a TRADE and the cost sentence spends "another of your **officers**", and "officer" is not in `NOUN_SRC` | M | DONE |
| A20 | **`detonate` (+44.4 at t3) is a one-line fix that creates a tier violation, so it needs an owner.** The sacrifice-side override uses a 32-character window that reaches back past the GOVERNING verb, so "Sacrifice one pawn **to clear** all pieces on its adjacent squares" scores the enemy pieces as the holder's own cost: **-3.9 instead of +3.9**. Scoping the override to the nearest verb reads the card correctly at **+2.9**, whose floor is t4 against a t3 card, so `--check` exits 1 the moment it lands. Round 9 diagnosed it and deliberately did not half-do it | S | TODO |
| A21 | **`bn4_endless_militia` (+35 at t4): the engine disagrees with a written refusal, and overturning one silently is not on.** "The first three of your pawns **that are captured** each return" is blocked twice by deliberate rules: `TRIGGER_OPENER`'s `the (first\|next) N of` blanks the clause, and `GAP_DISQUALIFY`'s `captured` carries a comment naming this exact sentence and calling it "a trigger wearing an effect's clothes". The engine says otherwise (`charges = 3`, `api.place(sq, "p")`), so the comment is wrong. Somebody has to settle it rather than a worker deciding unilaterally | S | TODO |
| A22 | **`hw3_time_bomb` and `atomic_captures` need the `after` window to SKIP trailing phrases, not to widen.** "every enemy piece **except the king standing on or next to that square** is blown off" puts the passive verb 54 characters past its subject against a 45-character window. Widening to 60 was measured: it still does not reach this card, it moves six unrelated cards, and it pushes `blood_pact` above its floor, creating a violation. So the fix is exclusion-stripping ("except the king") and locative-stripping ("standing on or next to that square"). `atomic_captures` additionally has `captured` inside the gap, which `GAP_DISQUALIFY` refuses, so no window change can ever reach it | M | TODO |
| A23 | **`NOUN_SRC` is missing the collective nouns.** "officer" at least, and probably "royal" and "heavy". That gap is the whole reason `bw2_alchemists_trade` is unreadable on its cost side and is the sole `KNOWN_MISREAD` row; closing it retires that row. Separately, `pay_to_win` (+33.3) needs compound adjectives in `MODIFIER` ("a **store-bought** copy" fails `QUANT`, so the indefinite-article guard zeroes it), which would also catch "b-file pawn", "non-king pieces" and "last-moved piece" across about 22 cards and therefore wants its own diff | S | TODO |
| A24 | **Defection doubling currently only fires on the anaphor path.** A piece that "defects to your side" is worth DOUBLE (it leaves one army and joins the other), and round 9 implemented that for the anaphoric shape only. `divine_mandate` (M=3, t6) and `wa_dominate_major` (M=5, t7) are the same mechanic on the main `emit` path and would become 6 and 10; both were checked and stay legal, but they were out of scope. The trap is `gm_river_card`, whose "defects" is sign -1 and must stay that way | S | TODO |
| A25 | **On the frozen-clock Durable Object path the node cap allows about 4.4x the budget's worth of real CPU.** Measured in round 9: an 80ms nominal budget burns 0.96 to 1.98s there. `Date.now()` does not advance during synchronous compute on Workers, so the clock check never fires and the node cap is the only abort; the cap was sized against a nodes-per-millisecond estimate rather than against measured wall time. Pre-existing and untouched by the deadline change (which only made the clock fire earlier, i.e. safer). Tightening it is a strength change to the DO fallback and wants its own measurement **RE-MEASURED (round 11) and the number in this row was wrong by a factor of four, in the dangerous direction.** `scripts/bench-node-throughput.ts` (new) drives `pickAIMove` over 27 middlegame positions at five budgets and two levels: throughput on the CURRENT engine is **186 nodes/ms median, p05 103, max 369**, not the ~450 the cap was sized against in July, because round 8 put buff augmentation inside `genMoves` and made every node more expensive. So the cap of 2000 nodes per ms-of-budget is **10.75x the budget at the median position and 19.34x at the slowest**, not 4.4x. An 80ms ask can burn 1.55s. **Not fixed, deliberately.** I wrote a frozen-clock probe (search once checks whether `Date.now()` has advanced after 8000 nodes and, if it has not, re-sizes the cap to bound CPU rather than runaway) and then reverted it: it changes abort logic on a path that CANNOT be tested here, because Durable Objects do not run under `next dev`, and shipping unverified abort logic is how the July `exceededCpu` incident happened in the first place. Lowering `NODES_PER_MS` outright is the wrong fix and the numbers say so: a fast desktop searches several times quicker than this loaded box, so a cap tight enough to help Workers would start biting before the clock in ordinary browsers and cost playing strength on the main path to fix a rare one. The probe shape is right; it needs a Workers-side measurement before it ships | S | DIAGNOSED |
| A26 | **`MoveReview`'s `REVIEW_BUDGET_MS` now buys half the search it used to.** The deadline change means the same number is now a real ceiling rather than a midpoint. Its same-even-depth guarantee is what makes the classification meaningful (an odd-depth search hands the side to move the last word), so confirm that guarantee still holds at the new effective depth before trusting a review **ANSWERED (round 11): a non-issue, and now measured rather than assumed.** `scripts/bench-move-review.ts` (new, wired up as `npm run test:move-review`) drives `analyzeBoard` at the shipped 60ms over 51 middlegame positions: **51/51 reach depth 2**, p50 11.1ms, p95 29.1ms, worst 40.5ms. The budget was never the binding constraint and the hard deadline cost the review nothing: given 300ms the same positions still finish in a worst case of 37.6ms, because depth 2 costs what it costs and the deepening loop stops on its own. Also worth recording: the same-even-depth guarantee is ENFORCED, not assumed. `classifyLoss` returns "unclear" for `depth < 2 || depth % 2 !== 0`, so a budget too small degrades the review into saying nothing rather than into a wrong grade. The margin is 1.5x on this box, so a device that much slower degrades safely | S | DONE |
| A15 | **A13 costs a buff-holding bot one ply at the 60ms budget floor, and that floor is where bullet lives.** `aiBudgetMs` clamps to `max(60, min(base, clock/10))`, so any bot under about 0.6s of remaining clock searches at 60ms, and a holder of a move-granting card now completes depth 2 there instead of 3. Measured, not inferred (`npm run bench:search-buffs`). Zero cost when no such card is held, and no cost at medium's real 700ms budget. Whether that trade is right is a design call nobody has made: a search that sees the card correctly at depth 2 may or may not beat one that sees it wrongly at depth 3, and the paired A/B (-0.9 +-3.6 pt) cannot separate them. The lever if it turns out to matter is the budget floor, not the augment code | S | TODO |
| A16 | Every search budget worth up to twice what its caller asked for. DONE (round 9): `negamax` hard-deadlines at the ask. The decision was a controlled experiment rather than a preference. The argument FOR the old headroom, that aborting mid-depth throws the whole depth away, buys nothing: **at an equal wall ceiling the hard deadline reaches the same depth** (asked 120 at 1x reaches depth 3.1, exactly what asked 60 at 2x reached; asked 4000 at 1x reaches 5.2, exactly what asked 2000 at 2x reached), over 27 midgame positions from three openings. And the old behaviour was not headroom occasionally used: **52 of 54 samples ran past the asked number and the max landed on the 2x abort exactly.** It was a hidden 2x invisible at every call site. Zero searches returned depth 0 in 162 samples, so no "always finish depth 1" exemption was needed. `LEVELS.budgetMs` doubled (medium 700 to 1400, hard 2000 to 4000) so the real think times are unchanged and only the label moved. Workers path proved unchanged: with the clock frozen the way the win-rate harness freezes it, old and new visit IDENTICAL node counts and reach identical depths at every budget the DO fallback sees, so the two running sims stay comparable | S | DONE |
| A17 | `/game/[id]` stranding a viewer on "Connecting..." forever. DONE (round 9), reproduced before it was fixed (`scripts/repro-a17-connecting.mjs` makes `isArenaGameLive` throw): before, **still connecting after 30000ms** with an unhandled `pageerror`; after, **left the skeleton after 1926ms** onto "Something interrupted the game" with the thrown message and a way back to the lobby, and no unhandled rejection. An ordinary failure with the shim removed reaches a terminal state in 2065ms. The recovery runs in its own `try` with an outer backstop that always lands on a terminal mode, `isArenaGameLive` is called as `.catch(() => false)` so its documented fail-soft is enforced at the call site rather than assumed of the helper, and the three unawaited calls are now explicit `void spectate(...)` | S | DONE |
| A18 | Move the eval search off the main thread. DONE (round 9): `src/workers/evalWorker.ts` and `evalClient.ts` (one ref-counted shared thread, watchdog, sticky fallback), with the idle ladder kept for browsers without workers and every rung clamped to 24ms there. `data-eval-thread` says which path ran. The clean measurement is one ply on a quiet page: **longest task 110ms to 58-90ms**, and the 110ms was the ladder's deepest rung exactly, i.e. the search WAS the longest task. Two caveats stated rather than buried: at about one keypress a second, before and after both record **0** long tasks, so that run says nothing; and at a held arrow key the numbers overlap, because the analysis page's own per-ply render is 50-120ms under `next dev` and swamps the eval. **Round 8's 32/111/817 figures are not comparable to these** and its "engine off" baseline row was an artefact: pressing the Engine toggle itself adds 23 to 39 long tasks | M | DONE |
| A19 | **A live in-game eval bar needs a settings flag and a rated-play policy before it can exist.** `OnlineMatch`'s strip is gated on `game.result` because a live engine readout beside your own board in a rated game is engine assistance whatever it is labelled, and Lichess disables computer analysis during play for exactly this reason. Gating on the result also means it costs a player nothing while their clock runs, because it never runs | S | TODO |

### The ladder the model settled on (round 1)

`scripts/material-model.ts` scores every active card for effective material `M`
(pieces gained plus pieces denied, discounted by permanence, conditionality and
stated odds), then charges a tier floor for it.

The honest finding is that **the measurement establishes a direction and a lower
bound, not a rate.** One tier rung is worth about 0.93 win-rate points. Cards
carrying no material average +0.9 points; a card granting a minor averages
+15.6, which is 15.9 rungs of excess power for something the ladder charges 3
rungs for. Every material band measures above the no-material baseline by more
than the ladder charges. But the buckets hold 8 to 14 cards against a median
per-card error bar of 12.2 points, so they cannot pin the rate: the "pawn to a
minor" bucket out-measures the "rook" bucket, which is sampling noise, not a
fact about the game.

So the ladder is anchored **structurally** on the two floors the 2026-09 pass
already pinned in `scripts/test-balance-pass-2026-09.ts` (extra piece-class is
tier 4, amazon-class is tier 7). The line through those two points is
**0.5 tiers per point of material**:

| M | floor | what that is |
|---|---|---|
| under 0.75 | t1 | under the parser's own resolution |
| 0.75 | t2 | a pawn behind a lease, a gate, or the odds |
| 1.5 | t3 | a clean permanent pawn |
| 2.5 | **t4** | a minor (anchor: Cathedral Choir and Summon Knight already sit here) |
| 4.5 | t5 | a rook |
| 6.5 | t6 | a rook and a pawn, or two minors |
| 8.5 | **t7** | a queen (anchor) |
| 12 | t8 | queen and rook; the tier ceiling starts binding |
| 18 | t9 | apex |

### What round 2 did with it

Round 1 reported **28 violations**. Reading them one at a time found that ten
were the parser's fault, not the library's, so the fix went into the parser
first and the tiers second:

- an unstated promotion target was assumed to be a **queen**, which priced a
  minor's worth of upgrade at eight points (`bw3_heir_apparent`, and three more
  that were never violations but were scored four times too high). It is now
  priced at the cheapest promotion the game allows.
- a stated **plural** target was missed entirely, so "promote to knights" fell
  through to the same queen default (`promotion_storm`).
- a lease only counted when the card said "**then** vanishes", so "appears there
  **and** vanishes after 4 of your turns" was read as permanent (`phantom_rook`,
  `ww_mercenary_queen`: a four-turn rook and a three-turn queen priced as real
  ones).
- a **cost clause** reached by a conjunction was billed to nobody: "one of your
  own pawns bursts in the mess **and is lost** too" (`wc_pinata`), and the same
  hole hid the minor Apotheosis spends and the piece Funeral Pyre lights.
- an "**up to N**" in front of a list was applied to the first member only, so
  "up to two of your knights and bishops" bought three pieces
  (`bw2_queens_testament`) and "up to two ... knights or bishops" lost the
  discount altogether (`ww_last_reserves`).
- a **roulette table** with odds on no branch was scored as if the winning
  branch were certain (`cs_roulette`); it is refused now, like the other
  gambling ladders.
- a **pronoun** was bound to an antecedent two sentences back, and to a whole
  sentence rather than to a clause. Both are now one sentence and one clause.

That left **18 real violations**, and all 18 moved. `wa_conjure_bishop`, the
card that started this, scores M=3.00 and moved t3 to t4, landing exactly on the
minor anchor beside the cards that already do the same thing.

Two rows the parser still reads wrong are held out **by name** in
`KNOWN_MISREAD`, with the line of the engine that settles each and the parser
fix that would retire the entry (A9). Neither was moved.

Parser coverage is **67 percent** of the cards in a material effect category,
with 10 refused outright (gambling ladders whose branch odds are stated only in
total). The gaps are work, not noise: 18 of 40 mass-removal cards score nothing,
and three of the strongest measured cards in the library
(`bn4_endless_militia` +35.0, `total_atomic` +33.3, `atomic_captures` +31.8) sit
in that gap. The invariant is therefore an explicit **table of hand-checked
cards**, not a blanket "every card clears its model floor", so it cannot enforce
the parser's blind spots as design rules.

### The three model-versus-measurement conflicts, settled

- **`bn4_care_package` +41.7 +-14.9 at M=1.90 (2.8 sigma, the only one of the
  three that resolves).** Round 2 read this as the model under-pricing the
  POCKET: `legalMoves` appends drops after every nerf and effect filter, onto
  any empty square on the whole board, and counts them for stalemate
  resolution, so a pocketed knight can appear on a fork square with no travel
  and nothing able to stop it, and the model charges 0.95 for that. Filed as
  A8, and **round 7 measured the family and did not support it**: the thirteen
  pocket cards average +1.1pt against their tier while the other 71
  material-carrying cards average +7.3pt, a 1.3 sigma difference the wrong way.
  This row is the top of a spread that reaches -16.7 for the same payload
  class. One 2.8 sigma row in a family that averages nothing is a row, not a
  finding.
- **`queens_rampage` -13.6 +-13.6 at t7 (1.00 sigma: not a measurement).** The
  card is fine and stays at t7, well above its M=3.90 floor. The sign comes from
  the bot: `aiSquareScore` ranks an enemy-occupied square at 1000+ and an empty
  one at 7, so the sweep always ENDS on the most valuable enemy piece in line;
  the activation path never consults move safety the way a real move does; and
  the gate only asks for a minor's worth of target. So the bot trades a queen
  for a knight into a defended square and then hands over the turn. A play-policy
  bug, filed beside A6.
- **`legendary_forge` -16.7 +-16.7 (1.00 sigma: not a measurement).** Moved t3
  to t4 anyway. Its payload is `Bodyguard`'s exactly (a minor into the pocket,
  one later turn to drop it), `Bodyguard` is t4, and `Bodyguard` measured
  **+15.0 +-13.0** on the same harness. A 32-point spread between two identical
  payloads is the error bar, not the cards.

Round 1's two recorded over-counts are closed: `apotheosis` now reads the minor
it spends (M 8.55 to 5.70, which puts it exactly at its tier and removes it from
the list), and `wc_sacrificial_bishop` already nets to zero, so the note was
stale. Both are pinned in the parser's self-check.

### A6 settled (round 6): the search is blind to buffs below the root

Round 5 left `amazon_army`'s -25 open with a named hypothesis and the exact
experiment that would settle it. The experiment was run. **The hypothesis was
wrong.**

The instrument first. `pickAIMove` now takes an optional write-only
`SearchStats` and reports the deepest ply it actually completed and how many
root moves it considered, so "the bot played worse while holding this" and
"this card is bad" can finally be told apart. `analyzeBoard` already returned a
depth, but it takes a raw board and therefore cannot see buffs at all, which is
the same defect this ended up finding.

The hypothesis was that a 43 percent wider tree buys fewer plies out of the
bot's 60ms floor budget, so the harness charges the card for a weaker search.
Measured, on a quiet box:

| level | budget | depth without | depth with | root moves |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| medium | 60ms | 3 | 3 | 40 -> 57 |
| medium | 700ms | 3 | 3 | 40 -> 57 |
| hard | 60ms | 3 | 3 | 40 -> 57 |
| hard | 700ms | 4 | 4 | 40 -> 57 |

The widening costs **zero plies at every level and budget tried**. Alpha-beta
with move ordering absorbs it, and `medium` is capped at `maxDepth: 3` anyway,
which is low enough that 60ms was never the binding constraint. There is no
search-depth bias against move-expansion cards. That is a clean negative and it
closes off a whole line of suspicion about the balance dataset.

The real mechanism is worse and it was two greps away once the timing story
died. `negamax` and `quiesce` take a bare `BoardState`. Only `pickAIMove`'s root
calls `legalMoves(game)`, and `legalMoves` is the *only* place `def.augmentMoves`
runs. So:

```
ply 0   legalMoves(game)      57 moves, 17 of them granted by the card
ply 1+  generateMoves(board)  42 moves, 0 of them granted by the card
```

Both lines describe positions two of White's turns into a three-turn card. The
bot plays a move that exists **only** because of the card, then evaluates every
follow-up as if the piece were an ordinary knight. It cannot see a two-move plan
that needs the buff twice, it cannot see the opponent's buffed replies at all,
and it never models expiry in either direction. Holding a move-granting card
makes the bot's own move real and its picture of the future false, which is a
strictly worse place to be than not holding it. That is enough to produce a
negative measurement from a card that only adds options.

This is not specific to `amazon_army`. It applies to every card in the library
that grants movement, which is the whole `movement` category plus every
`timedAugment` / `permanentAugment` / `pieceBound` holder. **Do not retier a
move-granting card downward on win-rate evidence** until A13 lands and the
measurements are retaken.

Not fixed in this round, deliberately. The obvious fix is a board-bound augment
closure called per node, and it carries three hazards, the second of which is
disqualifying for an unsupervised change:

1. `makeBuffApi` captures `game.board` by value, so a per-node augment means
   either rebuilding a ~20-closure api object per node (too slow for a hot
   path) or mutating a shared one (a lifetime hazard).
2. Not every `augmentMoves` generator is board-pure. One that touches `api.rng`
   would advance the game's RNG stream once per searched node. That is exactly
   what `test:desync`, `test:snapshot` and `test:spectator-sync` exist to catch,
   and it would corrupt live games rather than merely mis-score them.
3. Applying the augment at every ply ignores expiry, so a 12-ply `hard` search
   would over-value a three-turn card. Swapping one bias for the other is not
   obviously progress.

`npm run test:search-buffs` is a known-issue lock, not a red guard: it states
the defect, pins its size at 17 granted moves in a fixed position so the file
cannot quietly stop measuring anything, keeps the refuted depth hypothesis
refuted, and turns its message inside out the moment the search starts seeing
buffs.

### A6 confirmed from the data as well (round 7)

The above is an argument from the code. `scripts/analyze-search-bias.ts`
(`npm run analyze:search-bias`) asks whether the defect leaves a fingerprint in
the 617 measured cards, which is a harder question, because the obvious
comparison proves nothing: move-granting cards do measure below everything else
(mean +2.6 against +5.8, and the gap widens to -19.1 at t7), but at those tiers
the comparison group is mass-removal and spawn cards which are genuinely
enormous. "Cards that add moves are weaker than cards that add queens" is not
evidence of a measurement bug.

**The obvious test fails too.** If invisible moves alone made a card measure
badly, the residual should scale with the grant. It does not: the slope is 1.2
sigma, and a threshold split PEAKS at 12 granted moves and decays above it,
which no real dose-response does. The three largest grants in the library are
`warp_step` (108 moves), `overclock_major` (39) and `reposition` (37), and their
residuals are -8.6, -5.1 and **+19.4**. Those should be the worst cards on the
board and they are among the best.

**The reason is in their text.** "Move one piece up to three squares ...
**once**." "All your pieces may move like kings ... **for 1 turn**." Against
`amazon_army` "for your next **three** turns" and `onslaught` "for your next 3
turns". A card spent on the turn it fires cannot be hurt by a search that
forgets it one ply down: the root sees the move, plays it, and there is no
future left to get wrong. A card that lasts three turns is wrong about every ply
it searches.

So the defect predicts an **interaction**, not a main effect. Duration decides
whether the search is wrong; grant size decides by how much; neither should
predict anything alone. Measured (both variables read out of the engine, not
parsed from card text):

| | slope, points per granted move | sigma | n | r2 | mean residual |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| expires in 2 to 4 turns | **-1.26 +-0.28** | **4.5** | 20 | 0.53 | -6.1pt |
| never expired in the probe | -0.38 +-1.04 | 0.4 | 6 | 0.03 | **+10.1pt** |
| spent on the turn it fires | -0.05 +-0.09 | 0.5 | 18 | 0.02 | -1.2pt |

Main effects, for contrast: duration alone **0.3 sigma**, grant size alone
**1.2 sigma**. The signal lives entirely in the interaction, which is the shape
A6 predicts and a far harder pattern to produce by chance than either half. The
grant>=12 threshold that peaks and decays is this same interaction seen through
the wrong variable.

The permanent row is the third leg and it sharpens rather than muddies the
story. A permanent grant has no expiry for the search to miss, and its holder
gets a buffed root on **every** move of the game instead of two or three, so
the search's wrongness never has to be cashed into a plan. **The penalty is
worst exactly where a card demands a multi-turn plan**, which is the one thing a
search that forgets the buff after one ply cannot build. (This three-way split
was found by noticing that `berolina_pawns` and `twin_knights` both measure +25
with big permanent grants, which the two-way version could not explain.)

Scale check: `amazon_army` grants 17 moves and lasts three turns, so 1.26 x 17 is
about **21 points against a measured -25**. The defect accounts for most of that
card, and for the family behind it.

Held by `scripts/test-balance-pass-2026-09.ts` section 1c: a tier FLOOR for all
26 cards, so a later blanket wave cannot cut one on numbers that look damning
and are not. The asymmetry is deliberate: the bias only pushes measurements
down, so a card here that still measures well may be raised freely. Retire that
block when A13 lands. Verified to fail when a floor is moved by one rung.

One measurement trap worth recording, because it inverted the answer on the
first attempt: probing duration by playing *quiet* moves reports a "once" card
as permanent, because its charge is spent by playing the granted move, not by
taking a turn. The probe has to play the card's own moves.

### Round 8: the fix landed, and it refuted two things I had written down

**The RNG hazard I recorded does not exist, and it was the one I called
disqualifying.** I wrote that a generator touching `api.rng` "would advance the
game's RNG stream once per searched node". `api.rng` is `fxRng(game, me)`
(`game.ts:879`), which builds a **fresh** RNG on every call, seeded from the
board signature, the ply, the colour and a digest of the public card state.
There is no persistent stream to advance. My note predated that redesign and I
did not check it before writing it as the reason not to attempt the fix.

A purity audit of all **283** cards defining `augmentMoves`
(`scripts/audit-augment-purity.ts`, which drives each hook through a
Proxy-instrumented `BuffApi` against a before/after snapshot in three
positions) found **zero** RNG draws, **zero** board-mutator calls and **zero**
unstable outputs. It did find a real hazard I had not named: **10 cards write
`inst.state` from inside `augmentMoves`** (`lossyAugment` sets
`inst.state.armed` and `dryad_grove` sets `inst.state.offered` when the move is
merely on offer), which per node would arm a live card off a hypothetical
position and burn its charge in the real game. Solved structurally with the
private view rather than by an allowlist, because 71 of the 283 never produced
a move in any probe position and are therefore **unproven, not proven pure** --
an allowlist would have been guessing about those.

**The null, and it is a correction to the round-7 claim.** A paired A/B with
the same seeds, White holding the card in BOTH arms and only its searcher
differing (`scripts/sim-search-buff-strength.ts`):

| card | pairs | buff-aware minus blind |
|---|---|---|
| `amazon_army` (3 turns) | 120 | **-0.9 +-3.6 pt** (0.2 sigma) |
| `twin_knights` (permanent) | 80 | -4.4 +-4.8 pt (0.9 sigma) |

The arms diverged in 33% of pairs, so the design had signal capacity. Round 7
scaled the observational interaction to about **21 points** for `amazon_army`
(1.26 x 17 granted moves), and at +-3.6 this experiment had the power to see 21
points and did not.

So: **the code defect was real and is fixed; the causal story I attached to it
is not confirmed.** The 4.5-sigma interaction is still in the data and still
wants an explanation, but "the search cannot see the card" is no longer that
explanation on the strength of a direct experiment. Candidate confounds worth
testing before anyone believes the interaction again: timed multi-turn cards
with large grants may simply be designed weaker; and the harnesses differ (this
one grants the card after a random 8-ply opening, the win-rate harness grants
at ply 0 from the standard start), which is a real difference and not a
dismissal.

The project's own harness at its recorded settings moved `amazon_army` from
**-25.0 to -20.8**, `onslaught` -4.2 to -4.2, `twin_knights` +25 to +12.5 --
all inside its own +-9.7 error bar, i.e. it cannot resolve this either.

**The section 1c tier quarantine STAYS.** It says "retire when A13 lands", and
A13 has landed, but the family has not been re-measured and the honest reading
of the numbers above is that the bias is smaller than believed rather than
absent. Retiring a guard on an unmeasured assumption is the thing the guard
exists to prevent.

**A third thing I got wrong:** the success branch of my own
`test-search-buff-visibility.ts` was unreachable by construction. Assertion 1
required `generateMoves` NOT to return granted moves; assertion 2's victory
branch required exactly that. It could report the defect and could never report
the fix. Rewritten to drive `buildSearchBuffs` + `applySearchAugments`, which is
what `negamax` actually calls, with an expiry assertion (live at plies 0, 2 and
4; gone at 6) and the depth cost pinned at its measured size rather than
asserted to be zero.

**Consequence for the ladder: no move-granting card may be retiered downward on
win-rate evidence until A13 lands and the family is re-measured.** That covers
44 cards with a measurement and 93 holders in total.

**But the ladder itself is clean, which was worth checking rather than
assuming.** The tier floor is fitted against the M=0 baseline, and the biased
cards nearly all carry no material, so they sit in that baseline and drag it
down. If the drag were large, every material bucket would look more excessive
than it is and the whole ladder would be tilted. Measured:

| M band | n | mean | excluding the 26 biased cards |
|---|---|---|---|
| M=0 | 533 | +3.99 | 507 cards, **+4.06** |
| 0 to 1 | 20 | +10.96 | unchanged |
| 1 to 3 | 38 | +11.28 | unchanged |
| 3 to 5 | 11 | +8.73 | unchanged |
| over 5 | 15 | +26.00 | unchanged |

26 cards in a 533-card bucket move the baseline by **0.07 points**. A6 corrupts
the per-card reading for one family and does not reach the ladder. (Note the
baseline is now +3.99, not the +0.9 recorded in round 1: the sweep has kept
running and there are far more rows behind it.)

## B. Feel: the practice-games loop

Findings come from actually playing. Each round plays several full bot games
(Buff, Nerf, plain chess; easy and hard; 1+0 and 10+0) and adds what felt wrong.

| # | Item | Size | Status |

| B2 | Drag feel: ghost piece, cursor offset, drop snapping, right-click cancel, touch drag | M | TODO |
| B3 | Move feedback: last-move highlight, check indication, capture impact, legal-dot weight, hover ring | S | TODO |
| B4 | Keyboard: move input by typing, arrow-key move-list scrubbing, a `?` shortcut overlay | M | TODO |
| B5 | Chess sound design pass (move, capture, check, low time, game end), separate from the already-dense card audio | S | TODO |
| B6 | Clock: low-time urgency, tenths under 10s, pause correctness | S | TODO |
| B7 | Piece glide tuning, and making `data-anim=fast` actually feel fast | S | TODO |
| B8 | **Every buff game opens with a modal over the board.** DONE (round 8). Hydration to a touchable board **4259ms to 2826ms** normal, 1419ms with animation off; per draft 4.8s to 3.8s; share of a session **39% to 31%**. The sealed vault sat doing nothing for 1150ms before opening itself (now 640ms; its own 920ms opening is untouched, because the ceremony is the opening and not the pause in front of it), `DEAL_TOTAL_MS` was a flat 900ms whatever the offer size, cards waited to land before turning over, the pick waited ~121ms on a card whose opacity had already reached zero, and **`data-anim="fast"` never reached the draft at all** because globals.css clamps `transition-duration` and this choreography is keyframes, framer transitions and timeouts. Not done: the board is still not live behind the offer, deliberately, since making it playable during a forced decision changes the game rather than the animation | S | DONE |
| B9 | Draft cards carry no selection state for a screen reader. DONE (round 8): `aria-pressed` at both call sites, and undefined on non-picker surfaces so a codex card is never announced as an unpressed toggle | S | DONE |
| B10 | Accessible names run words together. DONE (round 8): `sr-only` separators at the badge level, so a card announces as `"Spice Run . Item , Free action . Tier I , TRIVIAL . Use once..."` rather than `"Bricklayer Item Free action I TRIVIAL Use once..."`. One handoff left: the tier-numeral badge in `OppPlaysLog.tsx:210,302` is the source of the board-side `"Special OrderI"` run-on and needs the same `SrSep` treatment | S | DONE |
| B11 | **What is already right, measured, so nobody "fixes" it.** Legal-move dots appear **50 to 79ms after pointerdown**, not on pointerup, which is the Lichess behaviour and most of why picking a piece up feels immediate. A move commits in **171 to 272ms** under `next dev` on a loaded box, with the origin and destination updating in the same frame (no stall hiding behind the glide). The easy bot replies in **807 to 826ms** including any draft its move triggers. The clock shows `5:00` on a five-minute game and `0:08.0` inside the emergency band, so tenths appear exactly when they matter. All four are pinned by `npx playwright test e2e/feel.spec.ts` | S | DONE |
| B12 | Nearly a third of the early game spent unable to touch the board. DONE (round 8) alongside B8: **39% to 31%** of a session, measured three runs before and three after with the legacy constants restored for the control | S | DONE |
| B13 | The draft overlay and the game-over panel were both bare `role="dialog"`. DONE (round 8): the draft already had a name, game-over was named by the outcome word alone ("Victory") and now labels as "Game over, Victory", and both carry a `data-dialog` handle so automation does not have to match on wording | XS | DONE |

## C. Pages and device screens

Static counts before the sweep: 62 route `page.tsx`, but only 8 `loading.tsx`,
1 `error.tsx` (the root), and 8 files importing `EmptyState`. Design system
section 8 requires five states on every async surface. Most routes have one.

| # | Item | Size | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | `e2e/sweep.spec.ts`: every route at 360/390/768/1024/1440/1920 in dark, midnight and light, asserting overflow, one h1, console errors, text floor, focus, touch targets | M | WIP |
| C2 | Fix everything the sweep finds, worst first. The sweep itself was wrong about touch targets until round 7 (see C38), so its earlier totals are not a to-do list. Current state after the detector fixes: `/codex`, `/play`, `/friend`, `/settings`, `/puzzles`, `/lobby`, `/achievements`, `/codex/suggest` and `/inbox/[username]` are at zero touch-target findings on a coarse pointer | L | WIP |

## C2. Findings from the round-0 UI audit

Measured, with file:line. These are the concrete C2 work items.

| # | Item | Size | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| C10 | **The board was not keyboard-operable.** DONE (round 1, re-verified round 7). `role="grid"`/`role="row"`, a roving `tabIndex`, `handleGridKeyDown` and an `aria-live` region are all in `Board.tsx`. Measured rather than read: a complete move lands on board state (`sq12` white pawn to `sq28`) at 1440 fine and 390 coarse, in both orientations, and arrow keys move in SCREEN space (`ArrowRight dx=+87.1 dy=0` with either colour at the bottom), with exactly one `[tabindex="0"]` per board | M | DONE |
| C11 | **No board-flip affordance.** DONE (round 7). `BoardTools` (flip + `f` + a shortcuts sheet) was already on `/game` and `OnlineMatch`, but the rail is `hidden sm:grid`, so at 360 the flip button measured **0.0 x 0.0**: a phone had a keyboard shortcut and no button, which is the whole of what C11 complained about. `FlipBoardButton` extracted (button only, no keymap, so a second mount cannot double-bind `useBoardKeys` and turn `f` into a no-op) and placed in the mobile player strip, exactly complementary to the rail. Now 44 x 44 coarse at 360/390/768/1024, 36 x 36 fine. `f` also bound on `/analysis`, locally, because its flip is local state and must not write the global `flipBoard` | S | DONE |
| C12 | **No in-game eval bar.** The math already exists: `evalPercent()` and `evalLabel()` at `analysis/page.tsx:51-61`. It is not wired into `OnlineMatch`, `game/[id]`, `history/[id]` or the spectator view | M | TODO |
| C13 | **The 768 to 1023 tablet band is unstyled.** Only 7 `md:` uses in the whole codebase (vs 563 `sm:`, 114 `lg:`), so tablets inherit the phone-derived `sm` layout with a fixed 288px rail and a fixed bottom drawer | M | TODO |
| C14 | **301 sub-12px text violations** against the design system's own hard floor: 227 `text-[11px]`, 58 `text-[10px]`, 13 `text-[9px]`, 3 `text-[8px]`. Worst: `TurnCostBadge.tsx:57` (8px), `PlayerNerfCard.tsx:281` (8px), `Board.tsx:378` (9px), `clip/ClipModal.tsx:1538` (9px on parchment-500) | M | TODO |
| C15 | **Contrast below AA.** `parchment-500` `#7a7a7a` on panel is ~3.6:1, and it is used 92 times outside effects. Alpha-dimmed text compounds it: `text-parchment-400/40` on panel is roughly 1.9:1 | M | TODO |
| C16 | **No focus trap.** `useModalChrome.ts` does scroll lock, Escape and a ghost-click guard, but does not cycle Tab, despite 9 `aria-modal="true"` dialogs and design system section 10 promising it | S | TODO |
| C17 | **No `not-found.tsx` anywhere**, and no per-segment `error.tsx`. DONE (round 7). `src/app/not-found.tsx` plus segment boundaries for `/u/[username]`, `/game/[id]`, `/tournaments/[id]` and `/settings/[section]`, each saying what was not found in that thing's own words ("No player by that name", "No game with that id"). The `error.tsx` half was stale: `u/[username]/error.tsx` already existed and `game/error.tsx` already covered `/game/[id]`; only `/tournaments/[id]` inherited the wrong words and got one. All five measured at 360 and 1440, dark and light: 404 status, one `h1`, zero overflow, zero sub-44px targets. **Three of the four segment files are not on a live path yet**: those routes are client components that paint their own in-page state, and `notFound()` is server-side, so each needs one line in its `page.tsx` to become the boundary | S | DONE |
| C18 | **No `/settings` route.** DONE (round 7). `/settings` and `/settings/<section>`, deep-linked by PATH segment rather than fragment, because a path reaches the server and so earns its own title, canonical, history entry and a real 404 for an unknown name. Sync is structural: the whole settings surface moved out of `SettingsPanel.tsx` into `src/components/settings/rows.tsx` (**901 lines to 178**), both surfaces read the same config, and the model subscribes to `SETTINGS_CHANGED_EVENT`, so a write on either lands on the other. Verified both directions including a route row flipping live behind the open modal. Two traps recorded: a `loading.tsx` above the section route made `notFound()` fire after streaming started, so `/settings/nope` returned **200 with a soft 404** until the index moved into a `(all)` group; and `#appearance` did not scroll because the browser resolves the fragment before the hydration gate opens | S | DONE |
| C19 | **Invalid ARIA:** `role="lead"`. DONE (round 7). `Board.tsx`'s two call sites were already closed by the `SignatureCut`/`GenBurstCut` wrappers; the last one was in `src/app/dev/plays/PlaysGallery.tsx` (not `src/components/dev/...`, which does not exist) and was latent rather than live, one `{...props}` from reaching the DOM. `[role=lead]` measures 0 on `/analysis`, `/game`, `/history/[id]` and `/dev/plays` with 120 scene tiles rendered | XS | DONE |
| C20 | **Four dead components:** `CurrentGameCard.tsx` (superseded by `profile/CurrentGameCard.tsx`, kept alive artificially by the button-audit baseline), `AccountChip.tsx`, `BuffUsedToast.tsx`, `ratings/RatingCard.tsx`. None has an importer | XS | TODO |
| C21 | **Duplicated settings rows** in the `accessibility` section. DONE. Already fixed at HEAD in `3625f8b` (no `-A11y` ids, Accessibility owns motion). Two things were still thin and are now fixed: the section blurb was the bare label of its one row, and an Appearance row labelled "Theme" sat under a group eyebrow also called "Theme". Display labels only, so no setting key moves and no `dc:settings-v1` migration is needed | XS | DONE |
| C22 | **`npm run typecheck` fails out of the box** with a stale `.next` cache. DONE. Already fixed at HEAD via `exclude: [".next/dev/types"]`, and verified against Next's own source rather than taken on trust: `runTypeCheck.js` filters that exact directory out of the build's file list, so the repo tsconfig now matches what `next build` already does. The explanatory comment was wrong on the load-bearing detail (it said `next-env.d.ts` imports `.next/dev/types/routes.d.ts`; it imports `./.next/types/routes.d.ts`) and is rewritten | XS | DONE |
| C23 | Two mod tables forced horizontal scroll in the 640 to 760 band, and two header dropdowns were `w-80` unguarded. DONE. Both `min-w-` values were already gone at HEAD, replaced by `overflow-x-auto`, and the dropdowns already carried `max-w-[calc(100vw-1.5rem)]`; the same guard was added to the `w-56` profile menu. The overflow walk at 320/360/640/700/760 across 12 routes found **0 clipped boxes**, with every header dropdown opened at 320 and 360 | XS | DONE |
| C24 | Six icon-only buttons without `aria-label`. DONE. All six are labelled at HEAD and a full walk found **0 unnamed icon-only controls** across 12 routes at two widths | XS | DONE |
| C25 | `scripts/check-buttons.ts` carries a 61-file baseline of surfaces still using hand-rolled buttons. `--strict` only catches new offenders, so the debt is invisible. Work the baseline down | M | TODO |
| C26 | Weakest system-state pages, from the audit: `analysis` (no error/empty/loading), `achievements` (no empty), `history/[id]` (no error, no empty), `game/page.tsx` (16 loading markers, 0 error), `codex/suggest` (0 loading), `mod/page.tsx` (0 error). `tv/page.tsx` is the reference implementation to copy: it distinguishes "unreachable and nothing cached" from "first snapshot loading" | M | TODO |
| C27 | The `clip/studio/*` subtree (~1,900 lines) has one width query and is otherwise unresponsive | S | TODO |
| C28 | **Uppercase labels violate section 11** ("Sentence case everywhere... allcaps survive only in the LIVE badge"). Seen on the main nav (PLAY, WATCH, COMMUNITY, LEADERBOARD, RULES) and every quick-settings section head (BACKGROUND, BOARD, PIECES, BOARD SIZE, SOUND). Section 3 also retired the letterspaced-smallcaps pattern sitewide, so these are the survivors | S | TODO |
| C29 | **One light-mode piece preview is near-invisible.** In the quick-settings piece picker under the light theme, the tenth thumbnail (second row, fourth) renders as a faint outline on the near-white raised surface. Its white fill has nothing to sit against. The other ten are fine, so this is one theme's fill choice, not the picker. Worth checking the same set on a light board theme, where the same collision would happen in a real game. Found by looking at a screenshot; no guard covers it | S | TODO |
| C30 | **`--text-secondary` fails AA in light** on every surface: 3.71:1 on the page, 4.42:1 on a panel, 4.15:1 on raised. The round-2 contrast pass fixed the muted rung and did not touch this one | S | TODO |
| C31 | The surface ladder is fixed and now documented, but `--bg-hover` still measures 3.94:1 for `parchment-400` by design. Audit for muted text that sits permanently on a hover fill, which is the case that makes that number a real defect rather than an accepted one | S | TODO |
| C32 | **The whole spacing scale is 87.5 percent of the design system's px values.** `html` is 14px and `tailwind.config.ts` never overrides `spacing`, so Tailwind's rem scale resolves against 14, not 16: `p-4` is 14px where section 4 says 16, and the `p-2 px-3` "plate default" is 7px and 10.5px rather than 8 and 12. The touch targets are fixed with literal px, but the scale itself is untouched. Fixing it centrally makes the entire app roughly 14 percent roomier, and density is something this site values on purpose, so this is a design decision for the owner rather than a defect to quietly correct. Options: override `spacing` to px, raise the root to 16px and re-pin the type ramp, or write down that the scale is intentionally tighter than the doc and fix the doc | M | NEEDS A DECISION |
| C33 | `overflow-x: clip` on `html, body` (`globals.css:8`) means over-wide content is **silently clipped and unreachable** rather than scrollable, and `scrollWidth <= innerWidth` can never fail. Proved by planting a 900px div at 360px wide. Any overflow check has to walk the DOM for boxes past the edge with no scrolling ancestor, which `e2e/sweep.spec.ts` now does. Worth deciding whether clip is the right default at all | S | TODO |
| C34 | **A client component that fetches and renders its heading from the response serves no `h1` while it waits.** Swept all 28 routes for it, sampling 12 times over 3.4s each. `/u/[username]` was the named case; three more had it. `/game/[id]` on its connecting branch, which is exactly where an id with no game behind it sits until the socket gives up, while every terminal branch of that file already had one: now **0 of 14** samples. `/profile` was **8 of 12** (its skeleton branch had no heading at all, so a guest saw two seconds of a page with no accessible name) and `/friend`, a pure redirect shim, was **5 of 12**: both now 1 of 12. Four other routes reported one zero each and were an artefact of probing at `waitUntil: "commit"`, i.e. before the HTML was parsed; re-probed at `domcontentloaded` they are clean, which is worth knowing before anyone re-runs this. The residual 1 of 12 on the two fixed routes is a different and harder problem: it sits at the moment one branch unmounts and the next mounts, the same commit-boundary shape as the focus-restore case in round 0 | S | DONE |
| C35 | `/api/lobby` 404s twice per load on 8 routes under `next dev`. DONE (round 7). A route handler, not a client that swallows a 404, because a deaf client would also go quiet on a real routing regression in production. Production is untouched: `worker.ts` matches `/api/lobby` before falling through to Next, and the handler returns 503 under `NODE_ENV=production` rather than inventing an empty lobby on a live site. Lobby-related console errors per load **4 to 0** | S | DONE |
| C36 | `Button`'s `xs` and `sm` size tokens. DONE. Already `min-h-[44px]` with `[@media(pointer:fine)]` step-downs at HEAD (`1d4f4ee`), and `/login`'s tabs already 44px. The blast radius was measured anyway, because a change here would have touched every button on the site: 290 `Button`/`LinkButton` across 73 files, and every rendered `.btn-*` box on the five densest surfaces at 360 and 1440 in both pointer contexts. Coarse 44/45/56 with **zero overflow and zero wrap change**; fine gives the intended 36/40 | S | DONE |
| C37 | Disconnected and recovered states (section 8, states 4 and 5) on async routes. DONE (round 6), and the audit's "18 routes" was wrong: states 1 to 3 apply to any fetch, but 4 and 5 presuppose a CONNECTION, something repeating or persistent that can drop and come back on its own. A route that fetches once can only error, and its recovery is the reader pressing Retry, which is state 3 and already there; a banner on such a route narrates a socket that does not exist. **One route had the real defect**: `/inbox/[username]` polls every 5s and its failure path was `if (!loaded) setLoadError(true)`, i.e. silent after the first successful load, so a dead connection looked like a quiet conversation. `ConnectionBanner` is now a shared phase machine with a pluggable signal (`ConnectionBanner({session})` unchanged for game and TV, new `PollConnectionBanner({healthy})`) and honours section 8.5's under-2s silence, which it never did. The one to re-examine is `/tournaments`, whose `setInterval` is a purely LOCAL 1s clock tick that re-buckets rows, so the page looks live while its data is a one-shot snapshot | M | DONE |
| C38 | **The 277 was a fine-pointer number, which is a different question.** `e2e/sweep.spec.ts` measured touch targets in Playwright's default desktop context, so every `[@media(pointer:fine)]:min-h-*` step-down applied and every correctly-fixed control was counted as a defect: **258 at 360 fine against 81 at 360 coarse** on the same tree. The sweep now runs one pass per route in its own `hasTouch: true` context across 360/390/768/1024 (the old check stopped at 390 and so never saw the tablet band at all). Worked by shape: the wordmark link was 147.3x**34** on all 39 routes and was 37 of the 81; new shared `Breadcrumbs` and `SearchInput` primitives replaced one hand-rolled breadcrumb and four hand-rolled search boxes; the home footer copy had its height fixed and its width never was, so "FAQ" was a 24.7px-wide target that happened to be 44px tall. **81 to 20 at 360 coarse, 122 to 29 at 1024 coarse**, same probe both times. Two defects the sweep structurally cannot see were found by hand: the desktop nav dropdown rows (194x**35**, only present while hovered, and the band where they ARE the navigation is 768 to 1024) and the header icon buttons, which are `w-[44px]` flex items with no `shrink-0` and squeezed to **43.2px** on 34 routes with a long username in one probe run and 0 in the next | M | WIP |
| C39 | The light theme's accent "hi" was lighter than its base. DONE (round 8): `#3692e7` to **`#14589f`**, the same OKLCH hue at L 0.46. Light `--gold-leaf` AA failures over 21 routes went **23 of 23 to 2 of 20**; the guest "Sign in" link 2.75 to 6.04. Dark and midnight untouched and measured unchanged. `--accent-dim-rgb` turns out to have zero consumers anywhere in `src/`, which is why that rung was never re-pointed for paper either | S | DONE |
| C40 | Tier and rarity chip contrast. **Tiers DONE (round 8), rarity handed off.** A per-theme palette, chosen after measuring the alternative: the wash route is arithmetically dead because `.tier-N` is also bare text on panels, where `#e05252` is 3.50:1 with no wash at all. Hue and chroma pinned, only OKLCH L re-set, so only t4 to t8 move in dark and t1/t2/t3/t9/t10 are byte-identical. **180/180 AA combinations pass.** Light inverts the ladder, which is load-bearing: a flat "everything to the floor" palette puts t3 and t9 **0.0101 apart in OKLab, the same olive**, against 0.0961 with the ramp. `--tier-rgb` and the `.tier-bg-*` fills are untouched because they are washes and particle tints with no contrast obligation, and are mirrored as literal hexes in three files outside the change. The RARITY chips are C45 | M | WIP |
| C41 | `ModShell.tsx` is the whole of the remaining crawler-visible sub-12px text. DONE (round 8): 31 `text-[11px]` sites across `src/components/mod/**` to 12px, and the sitewide rendered count over 46 routes went **24 per theme to 0 in all three**. Two alpha spellings now name their rung and have zero non-placeholder call sites left | S | DONE |
| C42 | `creatorPlays.css` captions under the absolute floor. DONE (round 8) with the layout pass they needed, because a `.cpl-stage` is one board square (**44.8px at a 360px viewport**) and "CHAT DECIDES" is 104px on one line at 12px. Clipped pixels on a phone-sized square **81.6 to 19.4**, nothing regressed at 87.1px, and the two residuals are physical: seven glyphs of 12px bold display do not fit in 44.8px. Found in passing: `html[data-anim="off"]` sets `transform: none` inside a `.cpl-stage`, so any caption centred with `translateX(-50%)` was **not centred at all** in the reduced-motion still frame | S | DONE |
| C43 | **28 touch-target findings remain after round 7, on three routes.** `/tournaments/[id]` 12 and `/clubs/[slug]` 8: a breadcrumb "Tournaments" link at 18px, a club member row (`li > a.flex.items-center.gap-2.5`), and a player-name link that is NOT `PlayerLink` (it spells `a.hover:text-gold-leaf` directly, so the round-7 `PlayerLink` fix does not reach it). `/tutorial/first-game` 8, and that route is **flaky by nature**: its findings differ run to run because the game state does ("Recent plays1", "Dismiss Layaway Plan" appeared on one run and not the next), so it needs a seeded position before its count means anything. **STALE as of round 10: the whole site measures 0 touch-target defects.** These 28 were cleared by the round-7/8 `PlayerLink` and row work; the last surviving cluster was `/mod` (C54) and it is gone too. Anything new here has to be re-measured, not read off this row | S | DONE |
| C44 | **Baseline re-locked (round 9) on a quiet tree: 55 routes, 105 route/kind pairs, 518 distinct defects.** Two aggregations exist and conflating them is easy, so: the BASELINE counts distinct defects (route + kind + selector + detail, deduplicated across cells), while the per-route findings files count one row per CELL, and a route is 18 cells (6 widths x 3 themes). Distinct: 381 type-floor-12, 60 touch-target, 35 type-floor-13, 19 state-disconnected. Raw per-cell for the same run: 10306, of which type-floor-12 8313 and **type-floor-13 1914, down from 3325**, which is the 42% cut round 9's type-floor work bought | XS | DONE |
| C54 | **All 60 touch-target defects on the site are on the four `/mod` routes, and every other route is at zero.** They are not a regression: `/mod`, `/mod/cards`, `/mod/house` and `/mod/stats` were added to the sweep in round 9 precisely because a surface the sweep does not visit has no ratchet under it, and they arrived carrying 15 each. Signed out they render only the rail plus "This page is for moderators", so most of the shell is visible and fixable without auth. **FIXED (round 10)** in `src/components/mod/ModShell.tsx`, three edits to two shapes: 68 touch (17/route, not the 15/route the baseline recorded -- 4 for the Jump-to button at every touch width plus 13 for the rail links at 1024) and 144 type-floor-13 go to zero, and sitewide touch-target is now 0 | S | DONE |
| C45 | The rarity chips failed AA in all three themes and could not be reached from CSS. DONE (round 9): `color` is now `var(--rarity-ink-<r>, <dark>)` and `globals.css` owns the values. **9 of 12 rarity/theme combinations carried a failure before; 0 of 12 after**, with the 0.7 locked opacity composited in and the compositing model first validated against real screenshot pixels (12/12 within 1/255). Light common went **1.42 to 4.60**, light legendary **1.37 to 4.61**, dark epic **2.72 to 4.63**. Locked contrast stays below unlocked in all 12 rows, so the locked state still reads as the dimmer one. Two corrections to the values this backlog handed over: they measured 4.45 and 4.47 on dark, just under, and **dark legendary was at 4.37, a failure the handoff did not list**, so gold moved too | S | DONE |
| C46 | **`--text-on-accent: #ffffff` on the dark accent measures 3.27:1** on the primary button label (12 elements). `docs/design-system.md` section 1 pins the accent explicitly as what Lichess itself ships, so changing it changes the one accent site-wide and it needs an owner rather than a unilateral edit. Two related stragglers, both a 12px label dimmed with element `opacity-70` rather than a token: `src/app/history/page.tsx:99` (3.50 light) and `src/app/play/page.tsx:225` (3.10 light) | S | TODO |
| C47 | `GlossaryTerm` rendering `span[role="button"]` inside card `<button>`s. DONE (round 9), and the DECISION was made on a measurement rather than a preference: the nested term is not a phantom in Chrome's AX tree (`getPartialAXTree` returns `{role: "button", name: "castle", ignored: false, focusable: true}`) and its keyboard path works today, so making terms non-interactive would have deleted a working path. Instead the card face stopped being a `<button>`: the control is now a stretched `.card-pick-target` as the face's FIRST child at `z-index: 1`, with `aria-labelledby` pointing back at the face so the accessible name is still computed over the whole subtree and `SrSep` punctuation survives untouched. Verified independently: `button button, button [role=button]` **0** (was 3 to 4 depending on how many terms a card carries), 2 pick targets, 44px+ kept (298x229 measured), keyboard selection kept, tab order identical. `GlossaryTerm` keeps its `stopPropagation`, which is correct rather than the bug: reading a word must never activate the surface underneath, since a second click on a chosen draft card commits the draft and in the dock it spends the card. One measured cost, stated rather than hidden: the tier badge's native `title` now sits under the pick target on pickable cards | S | DONE |
| C48 | `.rule-ornament` uppercasing the tier label into accessible names. DONE (round 9). Read out of the live AX tree, a card announced `"...Tier II , EASY . Starting after..."` and now announces `"...Tier I , Trivial . Use once..."`. `text-transform` uppercase to none, letter-spacing 0.22em to the site baseline, weight 500 to 600, size unchanged, which is section 3's "plain bold heading: weight + size + colour, never letter-spacing alone". Verified 0 uppercase ornaments across the draft, `/profile/edit` and the nerf draft. globals.css keeps four other `text-transform: uppercase` sites, so its `check-case` baseline entry does not go stale | XS | DONE |
| C49 | **400 to 1200ms before the draft overlay mounts. MEASURED (round 9), not fixed, and the decomposition is the finding.** Hydration to the overlay being in the DOM is **332ms median over five runs**: 132ms for the board's passive effects to flush, **46ms for `queueMicrotask(setPhase)` to reach the scheduler**, 155ms for the overlay's own first mount. The cause of the first 178ms: `useDraftSequence` starts at `ANIMATIONS_PLAYING` and only steps to `CARDS_PREPARING` inside an effect, so at game start, where `sigBusy` is false from the very first render and **there is nothing to wait for**, the overlay is forced into a second commit anyway. The "Resolving effects" chip is painted for exactly that window, every run, while nothing is resolving. The fix is `src/lib/useDraftSequence.ts` deriving `overlayVisible` during the first render of a new offer on a quiet board, and it has TWO traps: child effects run before parent effects, so an overlay mounted in the same commit fires `onCardsReady` before the machine sets `keyRef`, `reportCardsReady` drops the stale key, and the 12s `CARDS_READY_CAP_MS` fires instead (the report has to be latched); and `phase === "DRAFT_COMPLETE"` is ALSO the state after a draft resolves, so a naive derivation flashes the overlay back on before the parent clears the offer. `e2e/draft-timing.spec.ts` exists because this machine has deadlocked before, so it wants a round where it is the only thing in flight. Dev-only inflation to discount: `reactStrictMode` double-renders everything and four or five Turbopack chunks load inside that window; both vanish in a production build, the extra commit does not. **FIXED (round 10)** in `src/lib/useDraftSequence.ts` alone (+197/-23): the mirrored phase is tagged with the offer version it describes, and a pure `deriveDraftPhase` predicts the phase during render for a version the machine has not adopted yet. Both traps are defended and tested: `CardsReadyGate` latches a report that arrives before its arm (trap 1), and teardown mirrors `DRAFT_COMPLETE` tagged with the version that just finished so the post-pick window cannot re-open the overlay (trap 2). Measured on my own re-run, not just the agent's: **offer render to overlay render 0ms, commits 1 -> 0**, chip painted 0/5 runs, hydration to overlay 259.8ms median (the agent got 228.0 on a quieter box; the 0-commit result is the structural one and does not depend on the clock). `test:draft-sequence` 20, `test:draft-timeout` 16, new `test:draft-derivation` 15, `e2e/draft-timing.spec.ts` 3, all green | S | DONE |
| C52 | **Card faces still carry real body copy at 12px**: the italic flavour line (`BuffCard.tsx:234`) and the "Note: ..." paragraphs (`BuffCard.tsx:205/217/226`, `NerfCard.tsx:144`), about 4 unique elements on every draft surface. The `Movement`/`Passive`/`Item` chips and the `.rule-ornament` tier word beside them are labels and stay at 12px. Also `DraftOverlay.tsx:1473-1486` ("Draft pending. Your game clock is running.") is body copy at 12px, but the sweep never reaches that state, so its density cannot be verified from a route sweep. **FIXED (round 10)**: BuffCard Tip / `Note:` / `Exclusive:` / flavour and NerfCard Tip to 13px, NerfCard's dense codex flavour 12 to 13 to match in-game, and DraftOverlay's three "Draft pending" lines to 13px (that state WAS reached, by letting a timed window expire). Left at 12px as bare tokens: the Movement/Passive/Item chips, the `.rule-ornament` tier word, owner label, Progress readout, Used/Nullified. **The cost is real and was measured rather than waved past: 228 of 1829 buffs with flavour text (12.5%) gain exactly one line** at a 268px card column, all 1 to 2, and at 360x780 the draft overlay's scroll distance grows 328 to 353px. Nothing clips: a same-render A/B forcing the lines back to 12px left `scrollHeight - clientHeight` at its constant 10 to 11px watermark overhang in every cell, at 360 and 1440, dark and light | S | DONE |
| C53 | **`DraftResolvingChip` claims "Resolving effects" for the whole ~330ms opening gap when nothing is resolving.** It appears in the same frame as the board and disappears in the same frame as the dialog, every run, and at game start there is nothing to resolve. Gating it on `sigBusy` would make it honest. Behaviour deliberately left alone in round 9 because C49's own fix changes that window. **Round 10: C49 landed and the chip is now painted in 0/5 measured runs at game start** -- it is unreachable on a quiet board rather than corrected, so the dishonest wording still stands for the busy-board case. **FIXED (round 10)**: the chip is now gated on `sigBusy` as well. Stated honestly, because it matters for how much this is worth: **on today's code this is not a visible change** -- C49 landed first and the chip already never appears at game start (3/3 runs, `?perf=1` shows `busy=0` on every opening `render:draft`). It is a correctness guard that makes the chip's claim true by construction and covers the tail where a spectacle ends before the machine transitions. Not verified live: a mid-game busy frame with an offer in hand, which needs a card spectacle and a draft landing on the same ply | XS | DONE |
| C50 | **The same nested-button bug exists in two more places, and in one of them nothing works around it.** `src/app/game/page.tsx` around 1528-1544 wraps `NerfCard` in its own `<button>`: still 2 nested `button [role=button]`, and measured live, **clicking the rule text there selects nothing** (no ring, no Confirm) while clicking the face selects. The buff draft has a capture-phase pick that covers it; the nerf draft has nothing. And `src/components/dock/targeting.tsx` around 270 puts a compact `BuffCard` inside an external `<button>`, where a term click swallows a target pick. The fix is the C47 one: move the stretched target into the card component and drop the external wrapper. **FIXED (round 10)**, and the port needed one thing BuffCard did not: `.nerf-enter__line` animates a transform, which makes a stacking context, so the rule text's glossary chips could not escape it and the target painted over them -- measured, `elementFromPoint` over a term returned `.card-pick-target`, the popover never opened, and **a second click on a word started the game**, the exact hazard `GlossaryTerm`'s handler exists to prevent. That line is now `relative z-[2] pointer-events-none` with `[&_span]:pointer-events-auto`, gated on pickable. `NerfCard`'s target is opt-in via a new `onClick` prop so the codex and `OnlineMatch` are untouched rather than double-wrapped. Verified on my own run, not the agent's: nested `button button, button [role=button]` **0**, two pick targets at 285x290 and 285x216, a click on the word "capture" takes `aria-pressed` false to true AND opens the definition AND surfaces Confirm, and a second click on that same word leaves you on the draft with no board | S | DONE |
| C55 | **The sweep's two touch/type detectors were each wrong in a way that made the number they report untrustworthy, and the `/mod` agent found both by reading markup the sweep said was clean.** (a) The "the row IS the target" exemption tested VERTICAL fill only, so a 36px chip inside a 45px `overflow-x: auto` rail satisfied it and a whole rail of undersized mobile chips vanished with no trace that anything had been forgiven. (b) `interactive` was `closest('button, a[href], ...')`, so every bare token inside a control -- a roman-numeral tier badge, a count, a state pill, a `Ctrl K` keycap -- was classified as interactive text on the 13px floor, when the project's own rule puts exactly that in the 12px caption allowance. **FIXED (round 10), and the fix for (a) is not the obvious one.** I measured three tightenings of the exemption (require horizontal fill too; require the parent to hold one control; require the parent not to scroll sideways) and **every one of them re-reports the 120 codex list rows the exemption was written for**, because a codex row carries a trailing tier badge and so leaves 25 to 95px of dead width beside its link and holds 2 controls. A rail and a list row are not separable by geometry. So the exemption keeps its threshold and instead HANDS BACK what it swallowed: a new `touch-target-row-exempt` disclosure carries each exempted control's size, its row height, how many controls share the parent, and whether that parent actually scrolls sideways. Severity `info`, and excluded from the ratchet by name, because ratcheting it would gate on correct markup and punish a route for ADDING a properly built 44px row. (b) is fixed on a measured fact rather than a heuristic: the 13px floor now applies when the element IS the control or its text equals the control's whole visible name (aria-hidden decoration stripped before comparing, or every control carrying a keycap would misjudge). A fragment of a richer control is reported as `type-floor-12` with a detail saying it is a fragment and to judge it by eye -- severity only ever drops, nothing stops being reported. Measured on `/codex`: type-floor-13 **4 to 0** (all four were `X`/`IX` tier badges) and 74 previously silent row exemptions now disclosed, 0 of them scrolling rails. **The consequence for anything already written down: the round-9 sitewide `type-floor-13` counts (35 distinct, 1914 raw) are inflated by (b) and must be re-measured before being used.** | S | DONE |
| C56 | **`OnlineMatch.tsx` carries BOTH defects that C50 and C53 just fixed on the local surface, and it was outside the round-10 agent's file list.** Line ~2399 wraps `NerfCard` in its own `<button>`, which is the identical nested-button bug on the ONLINE nerf draft (a glossary word there selects nothing), and line ~3680 renders the ungated `DraftResolvingChip`. Both fixes are now mechanical: `NerfCard` takes `onClick` and `selected` props, and the chip needs `&& sigBusy`. Cannot be verified end to end on this box (Durable Objects do not run under `next dev`), so it needs a code-level fix plus whatever the online harness can reach | XS | TODO |
| C57 | **`BuffCard`'s compact rule text is still `text-[12px]`** and it is sentence-shaped, so by the rule C52 just applied it should rise to 13px. Deliberately not done in round 10: raising it moves the dock, `MobileBuffDrawer` and the minimized draft panel all at once, and C52's own measurement says 12.5% of flavour lines gain a line at the normal width, so the compact width will be worse. Wants its own round with the three surfaces measured before and after | S | TODO |
| C51 | **`achievements/page.tsx` sets the locked chips' `opacity: 0.7` inline**, which is why round 9 had to solve the rarity palette with it composited in rather than replacing it. Opacity multiplies every contrast failure, so a `--rarity-ink-<r>-locked` token is the better shape, and light would then need only `#787367 / #008070 / #8a5ab8 / #916c00` | XS | TODO |
| C39 | Sweep totals moved 1791 to 1387 defects and 674 to 307 high severity across the day. The remaining high-severity mass is C38. `type-floor-13` is 305 and `type-floor-12` is 330, which is the interactive-versus-caption judgement call already in flight | - | tracking |

## D. Motion and graphics

| # | Item | Size | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Route and page transitions (there are none today), list stagger, skeleton to content crossfade | M | TODO |
| D2 | Draft overlay choreography: deal, hover, pick, commit, pocket flight | M | TODO |
| D3 | Game-over and the secret-nerf reveal, the game's most shareable beat | M | TODO |
| D4 | Normalise the keyframe vocabulary: audit ~5,570 keyframes for durations and easings that ignore `--ease-*` / `--dur-1..3` | M | TODO |
| D5 | Split `sigVisuals.tsx` (19.6k lines, 1.06 MB) so a game loads only what it fires | L | TODO |
| D6 | Split `Board.tsx` (5,045 lines) by concern: grid, drag, animation pipeline, overlays | L | TODO |

## E. Lichess parity and new surfaces

Research lands in `docs/lichess-parity-2026-09.md` and feeds items back here.

| # | Item | Size | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | Lichess behaviour study and gap analysis | S | DONE (round 0), see `docs/lichess-parity-2026-09.md` |
| E2 | Puzzles, and a daily puzzle. The roadmap's top retention ask: it works with nobody else online | L | TODO |
| E3 | The named-bot ladder. 900 personas already exist in `src/lib/server/bots.ts` | M | TODO |
| E4 | Analysis: eval bar and move classification | M | TODO |

Ranked from the parity study, cheapest first. lichess.org itself is blocked by
the egress proxy, so these were read out of `lichess-org/lila` and
`lichess-org/chessground` source rather than the live site.

| # | Item | Size | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| E10 | **Every drag paints the piece twice.** DONE. `.dragging` is applied at `Board.tsx:2275`; measured, the origin piece goes computed opacity 1 to **0.35** mid-drag and back to 1 after | XS | DONE |
| E11 | Bind `z` (zen) on `/analysis`, `/tv` and `/history/[id]`. DONE (round 2), measured on all three: `data-zen` toggles null to on. Not bound on the `/history/[id]` not-found branch, which has no zen-hidden chrome to hide | XS | DONE |
| E12 | Clock urgency relative to the time control (Lichess's formula) rather than fixed 30s and 10s thresholds | XS | TODO |
| E13 | Blink the clock separator while a clock runs. It matters more here than on Lichess because our clock genuinely pauses for drafts | XS | TODO |
| E14 | Wheel over the board scrubs plies | XS | TODO |
| E15 | PGN export on `/history/[id]`; it is already wired on the other two replay surfaces | XS | TODO |
| E16 | A shared keymap module plus the `?` help dialog. Buys `f`, `k`/`j`, `0`/`$`, `home`/`end` and `c` in one change | S | TODO |
| E17 | TV featured-game hysteresis (Lichess uses a 1.17x gate) and rematch follow. We reshuffle on every poll | S | TODO |
| E18 | Arrow polish: snap to queen and knight lines, bent knight arrows, the Lichess modifier map | S | TODO |
| E19 | Drag distance threshold, and tap-tap as the touch default | S | TODO |
| E20 | Move the analysis engine into a Worker. It currently runs a 300ms blocking search on the main thread | M | TODO |
| E21 | Move classification from win-percent deltas (0.1 / 0.2 / 0.3, Lichess's own thresholds) | M | TODO |
| E22 | Card-aware game review. `Analyze` currently truncates at the first card-enabled move | M | TODO |
| E23 | Move times in the notation panel. The draft charges the clock, so "where did my time go" has a real answer here that it does not have on Lichess | S | TODO |
| E24 | Give-more-time button | S | TODO |

Deliberately NOT building, with reasons, so a later round does not relitigate:
the opening explorer (a hidden nerf changes the legal move set from move one,
so opening stats would be noise dressed as authority; build a card explorer
over the win-rate data instead), anything mate-based, variation trees and
studies, correspondence (one day per move against a draft every 5 moves breaks
the mechanic), berserk unless the draft cadence moves with it, and a
pieces-only board editor, which can only produce positions that cannot occur.

Two conflicts to respect when E2 and the a11y work land: classic tactics
puzzles do not transfer, because nearly all of them resolve to mate or
material. The three formats that do work here are "capture the king in N under
this nerf", "find the only move your rule allows", and "two cards are offered,
which one wins", and the last has no chess analogue at all. And a screen-reader
board here has to name card state per square (frozen, warded, doomed with a
count, mined), not just pieces, or it is unplayable in a way Lichess's is not.

## F. Correctness and docs drift

| # | Item | Size | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | Guide pages claimed a 45% top-tier slip gate that no longer exists; `docs/draft-system.md` said cadence 6 (code says 5) and "263 cards" (1,665 active) | XS | DONE (round 0) |
| F2 | `.gitignore` does not cover the `AGENTS.md` that `next dev` generates | XS | TODO |
| F3 | Desync telemetry, Priority 0 in `docs/improvement-roadmap.md`. Needs real traffic, so build the hashing and the report surface | M | TODO |
