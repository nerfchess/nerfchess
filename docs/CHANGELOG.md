# NerfChess changelog

Canonical, version-controlled changelog. This file is the single source of truth
(the Google Drive copy, if any, is just a mirror). It is a timestamped, append
only log: the NEWEST entries are at the BOTTOM, so each update adds a new
`## <timestamp ET>` block and you keep reading down the file. Timestamps are US
Eastern (ET). Keep the append-only discipline; do not rewrite old blocks.

How to update it (do this with every change, without being asked):
1. Get the time in ET: `date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M %Z"`.
2. APPEND a new `## <timestamp ET>` block at the bottom (never rewrite old ones).
3. List what changed, with PR numbers and status (OPEN / MERGED).
4. Commit this file together with the change.

Other standing conventions: PR-only (never commit to master; the owner merges);
no em dashes anywhere; bump `buildVersion` in worker.ts on server changes; verify
with `npx tsc --noEmit` and, for server/engine changes, `npm run server:build`.

## 2026-07-05 18:39 ET (server crisis, bots, tournaments, feature wave)

Deploy / build:
- A collaborator added a Hyperdrive/Postgres binding (#172) that BROKE the Cloudflare Workers Build, so #168-171 merged but could not deploy until fixed (#173). buildVersion was a static string, so deploys were unverifiable. Fixed: buildVersion is now bumped on server changes so /healthz identifies the running build.

Server stability saga:
- Symptom: "couldn't reach game server", slow loads, then hard crashes ("Durable Object exceeded its CPU time limit and was reset", timeouts).
- Root cause: the single global Durable Object ran FULL match-table scans on the request path and first index build; under bot churn the table bloated and each scan blew the CPU limit before it could GC, so it never drained (death spiral).
- PR #174 (server-cpu-fix-1): emergency alarm throttle + no filler + version marker. Helped, insufficient. MERGED.
- PR #176 (bounded GC + persisted live-index, no full scans): the real structural fix. CLOSED to avoid competing with the collaborator's server work.
- Collaborator PR #175: throttled the scans + fixed lobby seek pairing + stuck bots. MERGED. Server stabilized (briefly).

House bots:
- PR #177: HOUSE_ENABLED flag to pause all bot activity (clears seeks, draws in-progress bot games unrated). MERGED.
- PR #183: re-enabled bots; roster 16 to 50 with creative handles (waterbottle, iloveproteinbars, flower, bssfan, grade11isscary, timmychenbiggestfan, josephleungadmirer, kingcongo, SIXSEVENHAHAHAH, anarchychess + fillers); load-test caps. MERGED.
- PR #186: fewer seekers (2-4), faster bot-vs-bot spawn (20-80s to 4-10s), caps 18/20, buildVersion house-tune-1. OPEN.

Features:
- PR #178 cooler draft: glass reveal FX (drama scales with tier) + Surprise-your-friend stacked preset. MERGED.
- PR #179 UI redesign: research (docs/ui-research.md), mode-seam signature, fluid type scale, de-bland home/lobby, lichess rating chart, snappier search. MERGED.
- PR #180 low-time warning sound synced to the visible clock. MERGED.
- PR #181 profile polish + custom emoji flairs + avatar/flair rejection messaging. MERGED.
- PR #182 rule audit (judgment): correctness / tier-fit / clarity fixes. MERGED.
- PR #184 board bugs: mobile premove cancel, illegal-move arrows, fullscreen/resize. MERGED.

## 2026-07-05 evening ET (feature wave PRs, server still crashing, tooling)

Feature PRs opened:
- PR #187 tournaments: lichess-style list + detail + join/withdraw + standings/podium; D1-backed; reversible migration 0015; auth-gated. Built from scratch (no lichess source copied). OPEN.
- PR #188 homepage copy (Nerf = secret handicaps revealed at end; drafting; Buff = no nerfs, draft power-ups; win by capturing the king) + 3 nerf and 3 buff clickable cards to the codex. OPEN.
- PR #189 loading/join speedups: parallel replay prefetch, in-flight connect dedupe, board skeletons, cached lobby snapshot, hero prefetch. OPEN.
- PR #191 draft settings on /play + fixed Play-vs-Bot (it silently gave both sides hidden nerfs) + true Plain chess vs bot. OPEN.

Server:
- Under the 50-bot load (#183 + #186 both deployed, buildVersion house-tune-1) /healthz was 1/10 OK even at ~2 live games: still the full match-table scan choking on churn. The throttle-only fix (#175) does not eliminate the scan or drain the bloat.
- PR #192 (server-boundedgc-1): revived the bounded-GC (persisted live-id index, bounded cursor sweep, no full scans on the request path or index build) reconciled onto current server code, keeping the friend's alarm guards. OPEN. This is the durable fix for the crash under load.

Tooling / process:
- Set up Claude-in-Chrome (browser automation connected).
- Moved this changelog into the repo as docs/CHANGELOG.md (this file) as the canonical, always-available, version-controlled source of truth; documented the update process in CLAUDE.md.

Notes:
- Anything visual is typecheck-clean but needs a preview-deploy eyeball; the game board cannot be run in the build environment.

## 2026-07-05 night ET (UI warmth pass, PR conflict fixes, moderator controls)

UI / design:
- PR #194 approachability/warmth pass, grounded in a fresh multi-agent research sweep (Lichess, chess.com, top UI, the AI-generated-look tells, verified brand hexes). Warm the neutrals and structure, never the single accent: warm text ramp (--paper + tailwind parchment), ink-ladder elevation (--surface-panel/raise/hover) for menus/modals/hover rows, warm hover-reactive hairline (--edge/--edge-strong), governed --pos/--warm status pair reusing the mode-seam hues, motion vocabulary (--ease-*/--dur-*), breathing hero aura (opacity-only, gated), .tabular/.press/.hover-lift/.stagger-in utilities. GameOver victory beat recolored to the Nerf->Buff seam with a warm scrim and a rating count-up. Shared warm EmptyState (history + inbox), dismissible first-run welcome, and an anti-slop guardrail in docs/DESIGN.md. tsc + next build green. OPEN.
- Merged current master into PR #194 and resolved the conflicts (page.tsx: kept master's clickable example cards, added the staggered entrance; history: kept the new EmptyState, adopted /play for Play vs Bot).

Server / moderation:
- Resolved PR #192 against current master (bounded-GC preserved; master's house-tune changes coexist in disjoint regions); tsc + server:build clean; pushed.
- Moderator house-bots on/off toggle. New app_settings key/value table (migration 0016) flipped by mods via a guarded POST /api/mod/house; the game-server DO reads house_enabled (cached ~15s) in place of the HOUSE_ENABLED constant, which stays a hard code-level kill switch. A flip takes effect within a few seconds without a redeploy: bot seeks clear and any bot game winds down. buildVersion -> house-toggle-1.
- Mod Players tab now opens on a default roster (the most recent non-guest members) instead of a blank box, and still searches on input.

Notes:
- The warmth changes are typecheck/build-clean but want a preview-deploy eyeball; the board and the Durable Object can't fully run in the build environment.

## 2026-07-05 20:50 ET (count-based cards no longer soft-lock with few targets)

- Fix: cards that collect N targets (teleport N pieces, "three of your pieces become amazons" like Titan Legion, remove/freeze/promote/advance N, and the removeEnemies / placePieces / voidSquares factories) soft-locked when the board had fewer than N eligible targets: you picked the few that existed, then got stranded on an empty step you could neither complete nor skip, so the card did nothing. Now they resolve with as many targets as are available. Central one-line guard in buffNextTarget (src/engine/game.ts): once at least one target is picked, a non-finishable step with no remaining candidates ends collection, so the effect applies to the picks gathered so far. Safe for structured collectors (relocateMany, Warp Sovereign, stealBuffs, lineSweep) which already self-guard or ignore a dangling pick.
- Test: scripts/test-hexes.cjs (npm run test:rules) now drives every activated card on two sparse boards and fails on any soft-lock or non-termination. Verified to fail without the fix (7 cards) and pass with it (149 activated cards clean). tsc clean; test:rules and test:nerfs green.
- Design note: docs/2026-07-05-count-target-graceful-design.md. PR #197. OPEN.

---

## 2026-07-05 21:02 ET (turn-cost labels on every card)

- Feature: every draftable card now states whether using it uses up a turn, with a small badge in four states: Uses your turn (activated, playing it is your move), Free action (activated but resolves within your turn), Instant (applies the moment you draft it), Passive (always on while held). Nerfs are labeled Passive (secret handicaps, never activated). The label is derived from the same kind/freeAction fields the engine uses to pass the turn (game.ts), so it can never disagree with actual behavior. Shown on the shared BuffCard (draft picker, codex, in-game modal), the in-game BuffDock rows (own + revealed opponent cards; mobile drawer via the same rows), the boon corner list, and NerfCard/PlayerNerfCard. New src/engine/buff.ts turnCost()/NERF_TURN_COST and src/components/TurnCostBadge.tsx.
- Audit: swept all 419 cards for turn-cost mislabels. Deterministic pass (scripts/audit-turn-cost.cjs, table in docs/turn-cost-table.json): zero description-vs-behavior contradictions. Semantic pass (multi-agent, all cards, adversarially verified) flagged 12; all checked against source and found to be false positives (the flagged passive->turn cards are passive move-augments or unimplemented placeholders, correctly zero-turn) or design/balance calls left for the owner (pieceBound upgrades that intentionally spend a turn to designate a piece, which the badge now makes visible). No flags changed: the derived badge is correct by construction. Distribution: 155 Uses your turn, 12 Free action, 129 Instant, 123 Passive.
- Design note: docs/2026-07-05-turn-cost-labels-design.md. PR #198. Typecheck-clean; test:rules green; visuals want a preview-deploy eyeball. MERGED.

---

## 2026-07-05 21:39 ET (walnut hex: lifetime fix + walnut-piece visual)

- Fix: a walnut (and freeze) is bound to the piece on its square, but the effect was only removed when its turn timer expired, so when the walnutted piece was captured or removed the marker lingered on the empty square or jumped onto the capturing enemy piece. New pruneOrphanedSquareEffects in game.ts drops any freeze/walnut whose square no longer holds a piece of the effect's owner; called after every move and after every buff board mutation (settleAfterBuff). The visual reads effects live (draftZones), so it clears with the effect.
- Visual: a walnutted piece now renders as the whole piece becoming a plump, glossy walnut (new WalnutPiece in Pieces.tsx: gradient shell, brain-like ridges, gloss, per-instance gradient ids) with the original piece shrunk down and nestled inside the shell so you can still tell what it was. Replaces the old amber-tint-plus-peanut-emoji marker; a faint amber square wash remains.
- Animation: the walnut pops in with a comedic crunch, then gives a periodic little shudder as if the trapped piece is rattling to crack out (globals.css walnut-crunch + walnut-jiggle; cut under prefers-reduced-motion).
- Test: scripts/test-hexes.cjs (npm run test:rules) now asserts a walnut is pruned when its piece is captured. Verified to fail without the fix and pass with it. tsc clean; test:rules green. The visual wants a preview-deploy eyeball.
- PR #199. OPEN.

## 2026-07-12 00:18 ET (codex card insights: stats + history on every card page)

Implements docs/2026-07-11-codex-card-insights-design.md. Not yet a PR.

Codex pages:
- Hexes and boons get their own URL namespaces (/codex/hex/[id], /codex/boon/[id]), statically generated like the buff/nerf pages. Old /codex/buff URLs for those ids keep rendering with canonical + og:url pointing at the family path (no redirects). cardPath() in cardCodex.ts routes the codex list, related-card links, and the sitemap to the family paths.
- Every card page gains a server-rendered "History" timeline: wave-introduction line (src/data/cardHistory.ts, dates from git + this changelog) plus room for curated per-card balance notes (CARD_HISTORY).
- New "In play" panel (client, src/components/codex/CardInsights.tsx): games carried / seen in offers / picked, holder win rate (hidden under 20 decided games) with tier average, last-30-days activity, popularity rank within (family, tier), house-bot split, plus "currently disabled" / runtime tier-move banners. Renders nothing on failure; static content unaffected.
- Copy fix: hex/item category blurbs were missing their verb ("As a hex card, it a curse...").

Stats pipeline:
- src/lib/server/cardInsights.ts: one full-scan rollup over the games archive into a JSON blob cached in new D1 table codex_insights_cache (migrations/0023, mirrored in schema.ts), recomputed lazily when older than 6h, stale-served on failure. Nerf stats from the nerf id columns (portable SQL via pgAll); buff/hex/boon pick stats from draft_record (Postgres JSONB lateral walk, D1 json_each fallback). House bots split by the hp_ user-id prefix. Both SQL variants verified against a real SQLite with known fixtures.
- New GET /api/cards/insights?kind=&id= slices the blob per card; Cache-Control public max-age=300, s-maxage=3600. Only aggregates leave the server: no draft_record contents, no draftSeed, no per-game rows, grant actions never counted.

Moderator change history:
- New append-only D1 table card_override_history (migrations/0024, mirrored in schema.ts), no actor column (events are public, moderator identity is not).
- upsertCardOverride/deleteCardOverride now read-before-write and record one row per changed field (best effort: an audit failure never fails the override). Events (plus a synthetic "adjusted" event for pre-audit overrides) are served by the insights endpoint and rendered as "Moderator changes" on the card page.

Verified: tsc clean (only pre-existing stale .next/types artifacts), server:build green, dev-server walkthrough of hex/boon/nerf pages including a seeded 36-game fixture (win rates, ranks, tier average, bot split, tier-move banner, and audit events all correct, then cleaned up). buildVersion bumped to codex-card-insights-1.

## 2026-07-17 13:30 ET (dungeon gate lobby CTA, chest reveal ledger, nerf-mode wave 2)

UI:
- The Open Lobby CTA (desktop hero + mobile OpenLobbyPanel) is now a full dungeon gate (new DungeonGateButton + CSS): carved granite courses, iron corner braces with rivets, an Elder-Futhark rune lintel that ignites on hover, torch-pooled jambs, and a clipped four-ember file. Complete default/hover/pressed/focus-visible/loading/disabled states; transform/filter-only state changes (no layout shift), decorations clipped inside the button, gated under data-anim=off and data-perf=low.
- Leaderboard podium keeps the same three-across treasure-dais silhouette on phones (smaller avatars via a matchMedia hook, tightened columns, risers keep mobile min-heights, bios hidden below sm) instead of the squished vertical stack.

Draft chest:
- New reveal-state ledger (src/lib/draftReveal.ts, localStorage): the treasure chest plays exactly once per unique offer version (scope game id + offer index + reroll count). Fixes the asymmetry where a NEW draft arriving while the panel was minimized skipped the chest (the initial packStage honored `minimized`) while a reroll always played it (the dealKey reset path ignored it). Chest now fires for first/scheduled/banked/apex/reroll drafts and unrevealed reconnect restores; never for rerenders, StrictMode double-mounts, re-delivered draft states, or refresh after the reveal was watched. The draft chime rides the same ledger; a Skip control under the sealed chest jumps straight to the deal. Online scope start.id; local AI games scope ai:<game.startedAt> (survives the save/restore round-trip).

Nerf-mode wave 2 (audit: docs/2026-07-17-card-library-audit.md):
- Combination guard: COMBO_TAGS exclusive families in draft.ts — turn-theft (8 cards), draft-denial (14), mass-freeze (2). The draft never offers a card from a family the caster already holds unspent; deterministic pool filter over synced state (desync/replay-safe); BuffCard prints the exclusivity rule on the card face.
- +28 boons (bw2_*, boons2.ts; T6:5 T7:4 T8:4 of the batch), +27 hexes (hw2_*, hexes/wave2.ts, curse-structured: marks, transfers, delayed dooms, spreading ground, escalation contracts), +16 nerfs (nw2_*, nerfs/wave2.ts, filling T1/T2/T7/T8). Family totals: boons 60->88, hexes 180->207, nerfs 342->358.
- Tier 6-8 nerf rebalance (12 cards, all documented in docs/2026-07-17-nerf-wave2-and-rebalance.md): after-my-move grace + warning hints for the instant-execution loss cards (boastful, wn_glass_queen, wn_pin_cushion, wn_house_of_cards), narrowed trigger zones (hold_them_back, abstinence, helicopter_parent, closed_book), announced windows (glorious_battle), capped requirements (inching_forward), budget raise (war_footing), death_wish re-tiered 6->8.
- Animation coverage: five boon templates + five curse templates, 41 unique per-card flourish dressings, 14 fully bespoke tier 7-8 scenes (boonPlays.tsx/cursePlays.tsx); shared-flagship ratchet unchanged at 381/45 — every new card has a bespoke flagship. Passive-effect registry regenerated: 639 unique compositions covering all 16 new nerfs.
- Verified: tsc clean, eslint clean (2 pre-existing warnings), test:rules, test:nerfs, test:passive-registry, test:animations, test:desync, test:snapshot all green.

## 2026-07-17 17:45 ET (wave 3: multi-agent expansion, dungeon lobby, bot identity)

Delivered by a seven-subagent pipeline (content audit, boon designer, hex designer, balance reviewer, animation mapper, lobby redesign, bot data consistency) coordinated by the integrator.

Content (audit brief: docs/2026-07-17-wave3-content-map.md):
- +44 boons (bw3_*, boons3.ts) and +40 hexes (hw3_*, hexes/wave3.ts) in the genuinely open mechanic families (turncoat/possession, summoned hazards, sympathetic links, contracts, contagion, comeback, clocks, terrain, miracles); zero additions to the saturated petrify/freeze/zone/leash piles. Totals: boons 88->132, hexes 207->247, ALL_BUFFS 1006.
- Balance review over all 84 cards: bw3_futures_market fixed (prepThree gated out the banked-apex path, the card could never fire as described) and retiered T6->T7; bw3_battlefield_commission differentiated from field_knighting via deficit scaling; hw3_hydra_hex T7->T6. Verified: no new COMBO_TAGS families needed, no ward-stack lockouts, no soft-lock paths, determinism clean.
- Animation map: 63 dressed-template flagships (unique per-card SVG dressings across the ten wave templates) + 21 bespoke T7/T8 scenes; 8 new transform/opacity keyframes; shared-flagship baseline held at 381/45. Registries regenerated: 1355 icons, 687 plugin ids, 675 passive compositions.

Lobby (Fable agent):
- Full dungeon-chamber redesign extending the DungeonGateButton system: granite Quick-match chamber with Buff/Nerf carved-door mode cards (igniting in-flow selected state), engraved stone time-control tokens with a mobile bottom-sheet picker, ember tab underline, segmented rune filter, engraved section labels, stone secondary cards, dungeonized loading skeleton, sticky CTA as a real DungeonGateButton on a torchlit plinth.
- Mobile overhaul: hidden tab scrollbar with edge fade (no active-tab clipping), compact one-row masthead, 44px+ targets, safe-area insets, wrap-safe rating rows, no horizontal overflow at 360px; FpsMeter debug chip is now development-only.

Bot identity (worker.ts, games.ts, ratingSql.ts, profile page):
- Inline bot-avatar browser upload for house editors (ilovenewjeans): client validation, center-crop + compress to ~200KB, preview-before-save, server-side re-validation through the centralized isHouseEditor permission.
- Username propagation: houseNotify records actor_user_id (notifications heal on rename), live seats re-read canonical names, retained seeks re-sync from houseLiveInfo. Rule: archived games keep at-the-time names; current-state surfaces always canonical.
- Rating sync: bestLiveRatingSql unified onto the most-played-bucket rule (ends the MAX-vs-most-played divergence), per-mode challenge seeding, and recordFinishedGame rating writes converted to optimistic CAS with bounded retry so concurrent DO + arena-isolate results never lose an update.

Verified: tsc clean, eslint clean (2 pre-existing warnings), test:rules, test:nerfs, test:passive-registry, test:animations, test:desync, test:snapshot, test:glicko, and next build all green.

## 2026-07-18 17:08 ET (codex rule completeness: two orphaned nerfs restored)

Rule content:
- Codex completeness audit: cross-referenced every card id defined in the engine against ALL_BUFFS + ALL_NERFS (what the Codex renders). All 1006 buffs and 358 nerfs already surfaced; found five nerf rules defined in source but absent from the Codex, two of them accidental.
- Restored two fully implemented, non-duplicate nerf rules that were defined but never wired into any registry array (orphaned in the b437f3c refactor), so they never appeared in the Codex or the draft pool: Clergy (tier 2, bishops cannot retreat toward your own side; extras.ts EXTRA_NERFS) and Hand and Brainless (tier 6, each turn a random piece type you must move if able; implemented.ts ALL_IMPLEMENTED). ALL_NERFS 358 to 360.
- Left the deliberately retired rules retired (RETIRED_NERFS: resolvable by id for old replays, out of the Codex by design): Foot Soldiers Only (verified exact mechanical duplicate of the live Serf Labor, identical move filter), Number of the Beast, and Hand and Gigabrain.
- Regenerated derived registries: cardIconMap.gen.ts (1355 to 1357 cards: the two new ids plus the deterministic open-address probe cascade through the generic File-icon cluster, curated tier 7+ overrides untouched) and passive compositions.ts (675 to 677: two new nerf tuples plus deterministic sentence-uniqueness disambiguation).

Verified: tsc clean, eslint clean (2 pre-existing warnings), test:rules, test:nerfs, test:passive-registry, test:desync, test:apex, test:snapshot all green; both new nerfs prerender their /codex/nerf/[id] pages and never soft-lock from the opening. PR #425. OPEN.

## 2026-07-20 03:20 ET (autonomous overhaul pass: bot-profile routing, draft preview, knight/bishop overlap, em-dash guard, rule accuracy, friends skeleton)

Delivered from a seven-subagent read-only investigation (bot routing, effect duplication, em-dash enumeration, skeleton coverage, mobile layout, sound coverage, rule text) plus hands-on integration. Every change verified with the existing harnesses; no worker.ts / DO change, so buildVersion is untouched.

Bot profile routing after rename (the "old link opens Account not found" bug):
- Root cause: a NEW username resolves fine (rename writes username_lower, the profile lookup is case-insensitive), but OLD names dead-ended forever. Player identity was denormalized only for display in two spots that no rename backfilled: the frozen game-archive names (games.white_name/black_name) and any previously shared /u/oldName URL, with no old-to-current redirect anywhere. Live, id-joined surfaces (leaderboard, Online Now, notifications, lobby/TV) already tracked renames correctly.
- Fix (single mechanism repairs history links, recent-games links, and old shared URLs at once): new username_history(old_username_lower to user_id) table (migrations/0037 + schema.ts, idempotent). Both rename paths now record the outgoing name in the same write (flagged-user rename in /api/auth/rename; House-bot editor in /api/mod/house/personas, folded into its atomic batch). Renaming back clears the prior redirect (no loops). The profile API (/api/users/[username]) resolves a missed lookup through username_history and returns the current username; the profile page forwards with router.replace. Usernames were already never the permanent id (games/ratings/leaderboard key on account id); this only repairs the denormalized display name.

Opponent draft preview (bottom of the draft overlay):
- Replaced the single-line text summary ("Opponent's draft: Name (T3)...") with a new compact, dungeon-styled OpponentDraftPanel: small tier-tinted cards with the card face icon, name, tier chip, category, and a tap-to-expand short description; face-down backs (tier numeral) for tier-only and hidden states. Deliberately smaller than your own cards so your choices stay the visual priority; wraps without horizontal overflow; tapping toggles detail only (never touches the draft). Information permissions are unchanged: it renders only what the caller already deemed visible (showCards / showTier / reveal / lastPick), so nothing hidden can leak.

Knight-to-bishop overlap (Tier 3 vs Tier 7):
- Confirmed the pair: wa_spectral_minors (Spectral Retinue, T3 buff-mode instant) and bw3_mummers_dance (Mummers' Dance, T7 nerf-mode activated) had byte-identical effect bodies (swap every knight to bishop and back). Resolved by differentiating the T7 boon rather than deleting either: Mummers' Dance now also shields the whole re-tasked minor corps from capture for the opponent's next turn, so the army-wide re-task cannot be punished mid-costume-change. That protective rider is what earns the higher tier; the bare swap alone is a T3 effect. Distinction documented in-code.

Em dashes (static guard for the standing "no em dashes in user-facing text" rule):
- New scripts/check-emdash.ts (npm run test:emdash): a TypeScript-AST scanner that flags em dashes only inside rendered nodes (string literals, template literals, JSX text; className and other non-rendered attributes excluded) and never inside comments or SVG path data. Confirmed the convention is honored essentially perfectly: of ~1600 em-dash occurrences in src, all but one were in code comments. Fixed the lone rendered case (a cardIcon dev console message). Wired as a first-class check.

Rule-description accuracy (displayed text vs implemented behavior):
- Fixed three nerf descriptions that misdescribed their own code (the accurate text existed only in dead library.ts stubs that the implemented cards shadow): Thunderdome now says a piece in the center 16 can never leave the zone (the code makes it impossible, not "rarely"); Quicksand now describes the correct cumulative "second landing on the same 4th/5th-rank square, ever" rule (not "twice in a row"); Ichthyophobe no longer claims "Stockfish" (the engine is a one-ply greedy heuristic).

Friends panel loading (skeleton + error separation):
- FriendsPanel rendered nothing while its first fetch was in flight and hung on a blank panel if that fetch 5xx'd or went offline. Added a themed roster skeleton (pulse rows matching the final layout, motion-reduce aware) for the loading state and a separate "Try again" retry for the failed-load state.

Investigation findings recorded for follow-up (not changed this pass, to avoid registry churn / risky content surgery): several same-tier nerf mirror pairs (oddball/even_keeled, remorseful/one_bite_at_a_time) and tier inversions (onward_only T7 weaker than forward_march T5) where every alternative mechanic collides with an existing nerf (punching_down, theocracy), so re-theming would trade one duplicate for another; the persistent passive-aura sound layer is intentionally silent (effect activations already voice through sounds.ts, and continuous ambient passives are undesirable); a handful of low-severity mobile polish items (rating-chart tooltip edge clamp, a couple of username truncations, one wrapping button row).

Verified: tsc --noEmit clean, eslint clean (2 pre-existing warnings, both unrelated in game/page.tsx), and test:rules, test:nerfs, test:passive-registry, test:animations, test:desync, test:apex, test:snapshot, test:emdash all green. Visual/audio changes want a preview-deploy eyeball (the build env cannot render them). PR OPEN.

## 2026-07-20 04:29 ET (sound for every effect, complete card registry, whole-library card review)

Exhaustive card + sound pass (PR #428). Delivered with a 59-agent workflow (one auditor per card-source file, every one of the 1366 cards) whose findings were each verified against the engine before any fix.

Sound coverage for every effect:
- Every card's persistent effect (a nerf reveal, a buff/boon/hex acquisition) already carried a sound family in its passive composition (compositions.ts soundCue) that nothing ever played. Wired end to end: nine procedural Web Audio family voices in sounds.ts (decree, strike, bind, territory, tempo, blessing, summon, fracture, veil), each short and distinct, subtler than the marquee attack voices, gated by the effects pref + mute via fx(), and volume-scaled (tone() does not self-apply the volume setting).
- playPassiveCue dispatches "passive/<family>" to its voice, rate-limited (max 4 cues per 0.5s, extras dropped never queued) so a burst of reveals on load/reconnect cannot stack into a wall, and it only reads the audio clock so it can never autoplay before a user gesture. PassiveSpawn fires the cue exactly once per activation (ref-guarded against the re-renders that recreate the visual), one shot on spawn, never a continuous ambient loop.
- Result: all 677 passive effects (360 nerfs + 317 passive buffs) are voiced; the other 689 buffs are instant/activated and already voice through the cast/signature system. scripts/check-sound-coverage.cjs (npm run test:sound) asserts every composition carries a cue and every family has a wired dispatcher voice.

Complete card registry:
- scripts/gen-card-registry.ts (npm run test:card-registry) generates docs/card-registry.json, one derived row per card (all 1366: id, name, kind, category, tier, mechanic, description, animation family/primitives, sound cue/source, target). Everything is read from ALL_NERFS + ALL_BUFFS + PASSIVE_COMPOSITIONS, so it cannot drift; 0 empty descriptions.

Card review fixes (each verified; several plausible soft-lock reports were confirmed FALSE POSITIVES and left untouched, protected by the nerf filter safety net at game.ts:1130 and timedOppFilter's built-in fallback: cowardly, slowpoke, wa_jinx; understudy is guarded by heldBuffs dropping spent):
- Five reactive freezes added during the OPPONENT's own move with turns:1 never held: the shared post-move tick (game.ts:1505) decrements an opp-owned effect on that same move, so turns:1 ticked to 0 and the effect silently did nothing. Bumped to turns:2 (one effective frozen turn, the +1 the correct cards already use): we_frost_ward, wc_banana_peel_trail, kraken, the pt claimed-square freeze, the wa void-rift freeze.
- we_quagmire stuck a piece 2 turns while promising 3 (same tick convention inside mireSquares, its one caller); added the +1 there. wc_quicksand_patch reworded from "cannot move" to "can only crawl one square at a time" (the effect is a walnut, which the engine lets shuffle one square).

Recorded for follow-up (verified real but not changed this pass): a handful of description-count / placement mismatches (bw2_early_coronation promotable-rank range, hyein blocker-skipping wording, hw3_jammed_castle "two turns" timing, reinforcements back-rank exclusion, seance return-square, promotion_phobia back-rank reachability, castle_curfew move-20 off-by-one). ww_counter_charge and wa_stone_pawns were reported but are CORRECT once the tick convention and walnut semantics are accounted for.

Verified: tsc --noEmit clean, eslint clean (2 pre-existing warnings), and test:rules, test:desync, test:snapshot, test:apex, test:passive-registry, test:sound, test:card-registry all green. Audio and visuals want a preview-deploy eyeball (the build env has no audio). PR #428. OPEN.

## 2026-07-23 03:11 EDT

Balance overhaul (owner doc "NerfChess Balance Overhaul", 2228 named card changes). PR #445. OPEN.

Rule content:
- Full-library balance pass across all four sections: 949 buffs, 527 hexes, 404 boons, 348 nerfs. 837 tier moves, 1372 mechanical tweaks, 12 replacements, 7 renames (ids never change).
- Recurring templates applied consistently: duration shortenings (minimum one; exactly-one-turn effects grant one defender exemption instead), delayed activations (effects begin after the opponent's reply), first-affected-piece escape moves, non-capturing special moves, lossy one-shot charges, reroll riders and reroll costs, small clock garnish (5 to 15 seconds) where a card names no target.
- Tier 9 is now a valid apex band for hexes (special: true, never in the normal curve): The Curse Engine, Peace of the Grave, Mirror of Winter. Regicide left the apex band for the normal tier-8 pool per its retier; apex offers stay pure tier 9/10.
- Openers may carry a balance tier (opener() honors meta.tier; the opener pool still keys off the opener flag alone).
- Codex: every touched card gains a dated balance-history event (src/data/balanceWave1.ts, generated from the owner directives) merged into each card page's timeline.

Engine fixes surfaced by the pass:
- grantInventory now bumps the mutation counter, so pocket grants from hidden passive hooks reveal to replicas and can never desync the crazyhouse inventory (found by the desync harness).
- Living Board's targeting chain terminates after the optional king-step pick.
- Guardian-family openers enforce protection via move filters (the shared shield effect expired the turn it was added); flagged for a wider shield-family fix.

Harness/docs: passive compositions regenerated (1333 entries), card registry + card audit + animation baseline regenerated, desync scenarios and sims (cold_snap, phantom_rook, chess_diff, balance-fixes, apex) updated to the new behaviors. Full battery green: typecheck, lint, rules, nerfs, lab 2083/2083, passive-registry, apex, desync, snapshot, fairness, sequence, purity, emdash, sound, animations, spectator/tv/replay/archive, glicko, build. Known pre-existing failure left alone: sim-capture-accounting's perfect_rewind scenario references a card that never shipped (fails on master too).
- Draft picker: the gold selection ring now follows the card's hover lift on desktop (it sat 3px low); the minimized panel's ring rides the card itself.

## 2026-07-23 04:10 EDT

Owner follow-ups on PR #445 (same branch). OPEN.

- Animations: summon/morph/convert/promote signature cards fell back to a generic poof (or nothing) because the board suppressed their bespoke board-wide lead unconditionally; the suppress now applies only when a removal lead was actually staged. Oversize concern audited in both the DOM play layer and canvas VFX layer: already correct (one-cell parents, square-relative sizing).
- Draft picker selection ring: on hover-capable devices the gold ring sat 3px below the lifted card; the ring now lifts in lockstep (and the minimized panel's ring rides the card itself via glow).
- Draft lag: profiling showed the buff-draft ambient dungeon stage (23 composited layers) was the sole in-game jank source on weak GPUs (~14fps during drafts, 60fps everywhere else). Starfields now paint once, the ambient set follows the FX intensity dial, and sustained sub-30fps auto-downgrades the ambience for the session. Verified with CDP tracing before/after; full battery green.

## 2026-07-28 14:11 EDT (sprint overhaul: dead cards, notation, animation reliability, draft escalation, CI)

Broad quality pass. Every item below was verified against a harness or a
before/after measurement. PR #449. OPEN.

Cards that shipped doing nothing:
- The escape-curse helpers turned the restriction OFF while the escape was
  unspent and ticked the duration down anyway, so at turns:1 the opponent's
  first move burned the whole duration and the curse expired before it could
  apply. Six cards were live in the draft pool with zero effect, verified
  against a no-card control: hx4_early_frost (promises "your opponent's pawns
  cannot advance"; Black pushed a pawn twice unimpeded), hx4_hopscotch,
  hx4_hiccups, hx4_matins_bell, hx4_tea_break, and ov_paperwork_avalanche
  (reactive freeze at turns:1 during the opponent's own move, pruned by the
  shared post-move tick before it held anything: the same class fixed for five
  cards on 2026-07-20 and reintroduced by the later wave).
- Machinery fixed three ways: the restriction is live from the moment the curse
  lands (only the first affected piece keeps its forbidden moves, once);
  spending the escape no longer ticks the duration; and the duration only runs
  once the curse has actually bitten, bounded by a patience window so an
  unfired curse fades instead of lurking. The five descriptions promised
  behavior that was unachievable as written and were rewritten.
- New gate: scripts/test-card-impact.ts (npm run test:card-impact). Plays a
  scripted provocation line with and without the card and fails if the runs are
  identical. test:lab only ever asked whether a card threw, which is why all six
  passed every harness for weeks. Carries a self-check so divergence cannot be
  vacuous.

Notation:
- moveToSAN emitted no PGN disambiguator, so two knights that both reached d2
  both rendered "Nd2". The move list was ambiguous and every PGN from the
  Download PGN button was unreplayable by any reader. Added file/rank/full-square
  disambiguation per the spec, computed by replaying the line, with a divergence
  check so a board-rewriting card degrades to the bare form rather than printing
  a wrong origin hint. New shared helpers movesToSAN and sanLabels; the mobile
  drawer and clip captions now share the numbering rule instead of halving the
  ply count (which extra-move cards break).
- Analysis board numbered moves by ply parity, so any FEN with black to move
  numbered the whole line wrong and never showed the leading "N...".
- gameToPGN emitted no SetUp/FEN tags, so a PGN exported from a custom position
  replayed from the standard opening; numbering also restarted at 1.
- New gate: scripts/test-san.ts (npm run test:san), asserting no two legal moves
  in a position share a SAN, over positions forcing each disambiguation form
  plus a 5684-position random sweep.

Chess correctness:
- evaluateMoveRisk used the bare isInCheck while the board's check indicator
  uses the buff-aware gameInCheck, so a king attacked only through a
  buff-granted move lit up as in check but drew no warning on the move that
  hung it.
- makeMove cleared castling rights off move.capturedSquare alone; a
  card-synthesised capture without it left the right standing.

Animations:
- New MotionNotice: followSystemMotion defaults on and folds the OS
  reduced-motion flag into html[data-anim=off], a hard kill switch. Phones
  enable reduced motion for battery saving and accessibility defaults, so a
  large share of players saw no card animations at all with nothing explaining
  it. Shown once, only when the OS is the reason, queued through the same UI
  interrupt slot as LagWatch so it cannot cover a draft.
- .fx-one-shot scaled its 3.4s safety fade by --fx-dur, but roughly a third of
  the one-shot declarations never scale, so at the minimum setting the slot
  faded at 1.39s over art still running 2.8s: apex plays visibly cut in half.
  Clamped with max(1, ...).
- The zone-signature path (freeze, walnut, shield, kingSafe, stun, empower,
  rally, summon) mounted without fx-one-shot, so it had neither the hard fade
  nor the animations-off gate.
- resolveCardVfx was called without the generated family on the floor-fallback
  and zone paths, so roughly a thousand generated-signature cards got the same
  pale-blue burst. The floor fallback is exactly the path a quiet card takes.
- LagWatch's "Smooth it out" promised to trim the heaviest effects but only set
  perfMode and animationSpeed, neither of which touches card-effect load. It now
  also eases the FX dial to Calm, downward only.
- Per-card structural signets in basicPlays: 381 cards played a geometrically
  identical scene (35 on HoofSpring, 27 on GlintArc, 25 on SigilRing). Each now
  carries a constellation varying by arrangement (orbit, arc, column, corners,
  spiral, cross) and count, 36 distinct geometries, assigned so no two cards
  sharing a template share one. Shared flagships 381 to 86, tier>=5 63 to 42,
  baseline ratcheted. The remaining 86 are core SIGNATURES sharing a named
  visual, which needs per-card variation inside SignatureOverlay; left for a
  follow-up rather than papered over.
- audit-animations could not report an F4 violation (fail() ran before the const
  it appends to was initialized), and its flourish parser could not see a signet
  followed by another argument.

Draft:
- TIER_CURVE was [1,2,3,5,7] with later rounds pinned at the cap and a flat 45%
  slip gate, so every round from the fifth on rolled from one frozen
  distribution (20k seeds: T6 51%, T7 40%, T8 10%). A game runs about eleven
  drafts per player, so six or seven were statistically identical. The curve now
  runs to the tier-8 cap and the slip gate eases off late (45%, 34% from round
  6, 26% from round 8). Rounds 1 to 5 are byte-identical; round 8 onward lands
  tier 8 about 64% of the time. REPLAY_VERSION 10 to 11 accordingly.

Performance:
- countRepetitions built a position key for every position in the game. Only
  positions since the last irreversible move can match, so the earlier keys are
  skipped: 0.43ms to 0.17ms on a 150-ply board. Matters most in bulk replay,
  which the Durable Object does on reconnect, spectate, and every bot move.
  Pinned differentially against the naive scan in test:san.
- cardIcon.ts statically imported ALL_BUFFS and ALL_NERFS for a dev-only
  warning, pulling the whole engine card library and its transitive buff tree
  into every chunk touching the file, including /codex. Now a dynamic import the
  production build drops.
- Board prefetched the ~40k-line signature chunk on every mount, including plain
  bot games and the analysis board where no card can fire. Gated on the board
  having a draft state and deferred to idle.
- /game/[id] imported GameOver statically, defeating the dynamic() split in
  OnlineMatch, which is the only place OnlineMatch mounts.

CI:
- Half the suite passed locally but never gated a PR. New parallel content job
  runs test:animations, test:sound, test:card-registry, test:card-audit,
  test:emdash, the three draft checks, test:buff-purity and test:balance-fixes;
  glicko, san and card-impact join the engine job. Dropped a stale tracked
  build artifact (dist-server/src/engine/moveSafety.js).

Recorded, not done: OnlineMatch builds the Board's visual prop as a fresh object
literal every render, defeating around thirty downstream memos and re-rendering
all 64 squares on every clock frame. A useMemo there is a rules-of-hooks
violation because the component early-returns above that point, so it needs a
component split. Highest-value remaining client perf win.

Verified: tsc clean, eslint clean, and rules, nerfs, san, card-impact,
passive-registry, animations, emdash, sound, card-registry, card-audit,
draft-fairness, draft-sequence, draft-timeout, buff-purity, balance-fixes,
desync, apex, snapshot, glicko, spectator-sync, tv-spectator, replay-spectate,
archive-replay and lab all green. buildVersion sprint-overhaul-1. Visual and
audio changes want a preview-deploy eyeball (the build env cannot render).

## 2026-07-28 19:40 EDT (sprint 2: rating bug, board render, rounded corners, I Hate My Ex)

Continues PR #449.

House bot ratings disagreeing between TV and the profile (reported: 2600 on TV,
2300 on the profile):
- Root cause: games simulated on the OCI arena carry a seat rating that is a
  compile-time constant, houseSeedRating(persona), baked from the persona's name
  and skill (arena-service/game.ts:74). The arena service has no database. That
  constant rode through externalLiveGames and buildExternalMatch into
  playersPayload unvalidated. refreshSeatRatings does exactly this
  reconciliation, but only for matches the DO runs itself. The constant is
  numerically the frozen legacy users.rating column that ratingSql.ts already
  names as the root of the "ratings don't match between pages" reports.
- The gap is unbounded: a /mod/house override writes the database and the arena
  cannot see it; a roster revision reaching one deploy and not the other shifts
  one side by the full uplift spread (300 to 400, matching the report); and arena
  games are rated, so the real bucket drifts every game.
- Both ingest points now resolve the seat against user_ratings for the mode being
  played, via the houseLiveInfo cache that already holds that map. The lobby path
  warms the cache so a fresh DO instance never serves one stale payload.
- Same block: buildExternalMatch hardcoded rd:150, above PROVISIONAL_RD (110), so
  every arena bot showed a provisional "?" beside a rating it had held for
  hundreds of games (house accounts seed at RD 60). And the seat name was the
  baked persona name, so a /mod/house rename never reached TV.
- Decision extracted to src/lib/server/arenaSeat.ts so it is testable without a
  Durable Object; fallback is per FIELD, since a roster entry can have a
  canonical username but no rating row for the mode. New gate: test:arena-seat.

Board render (the 64-square problem):
- Board keys ~30 memos and all 64 memoized squares on the identity of the visual
  prop and its fields; OnlineMatch built it as a fresh literal in JSX every
  render, so every clock frame re-rendered the whole board. Last session's useMemo
  attempt was a rules-of-hooks violation and was reverted.
- The component split that seemed necessary is not: the early returns are at 2059
  and 2187 but the last hook is at 1924, so a memo above them is unconditionally
  reached and can guard on !game itself. Keying on game identity is safe for the
  reason `moves` already relies on: setGame is called in one place and every call
  site passes a fresh shallow copy.
- Memoizing visual alone would have changed nothing; checkSquares and the bare []
  literals behind legalMoves/opponentMoves/premoves feed the same squareEnv
  dependency list and are stabilized too. checkSquares' memo also removes two full
  gameInCheck move generations per render in draft games.

Rounded corners:
- Correction to an earlier claim of 1,230 violations: globals.css already clamps
  every non-rounded-full class to 1px, so the ~190 rounded-sm/md/lg uses render
  square today and were left alone.
- The real violations are the two escape hatches: component stylesheets (the
  lobby's primary CTA carried a 9px arch, the secondary buttons 6px, the draft
  reveal ring 6px on a square card) and rounded-full on padded elements (the
  AccountChip in the top nav, BuffDock buttons, tier badge, drag handle, toggle
  track, four profile badges). All squared; true dots keep their circles.
- New gate: test:rounded. Two passes, since the violations live where an AST walk
  over TSX cannot see them. Writing it first found six pills missed by reading.

I Hate My Ex: was a tier 1 card freezing one pawn each side. Now destroys every
piece on the board, both armies, leaving only the two kings. Tier 1 to 8, passive
to instant. Removal is `uncounted` (the whole-board-rewrite case) so the wreckage
never feeds the revive pools; kings survive so the game stays resolvable. A
comeback card by construction. New bespoke `exsmash` animation (a colossal fist
flattens the board, oxblood and ash) rather than reusing the wrecking ball, which
would have been two cards sharing one flagship.

Mobile draft readability (from a phone screenshot): the scrim was a flat 20% dim,
so on a phone the masthead, avatar and clocks read straight through the timer chip
and the clock notice. Now 70% below the sm breakpoint, unchanged on desktop. The
clock notice was a full sentence in wide-tracked uppercase sharing a flex row with
the clock readouts, breaking across three lines; it now has its own row in
sentence case. Dropped backdrop-filter from the timer chip (banned, and it sat
over the animated ambient stage recompositing every frame).

The three signature cards (I Love My GF, I Love Cami, Joseph Leung) pull with
their own rose-gold radiance, warmer than the tier 9 gold and tier 10 cyan.
Presentation only, outside the engine. I Love Cami tier 6 to 7.

docs/marketing-plan.md added.

Known outstanding (investigated, deliberately not half-done): the clock rebalance
to 1-2 cards per tier. 110 cards touch the clock; 69 are clock-only and 41 carry
it as a rider, and a sample of five showed five different clause shapes in the
descriptions, so a regex sweep would mangle them. It needs per-card judgment.

Verified: tsc clean, eslint clean, full battery green (san, card-impact,
arena-seat, rules, nerfs, passive-registry, animations, emdash, rounded, sound,
card-registry, card-audit, draft-*, buff-purity, balance-fixes, desync, apex,
snapshot, glicko, spectator-sync, tv-spectator, replay-spectate, archive-replay,

## 2026-07-28 23:20 EDT (sprint 3: the misaligned draft box, clock tier 1, exploit, mobile leaderboard)

Continues PR #449.

The misaligned box players kept reporting: found by RENDERING it rather than
reading CSS. Drove headless Chromium to the reporting phone's viewport (360x808)
and dumped the geometry of every bordered element in the draft overlay. It was
the countdown chip, and it was not internally misaligned at all: a separate
217x66 bordered box at y=51, above a panel that started at y=127. Two bordered
rectangles stacked with a gap, the upper one overlapping the masthead and
belonging to nothing on screen. On a taller phone, where the column stops
fitting and the overlay centers it, that box rides over the logo and player row.
Deleted rather than nudged: the countdown now sits inline in the panel header
beside the label it governs (26px dial plus the seconds, no chrome of its own).
"Choose within" went with it; a dial counting down next to "Opening pick" does
not need to announce itself. Verified by re-rendering: the draft column and the
panel frame are now the same box, and no separately bordered timer element
remains.

That deletion took two strings the e2e suite asserts on, and only the smoke test
was run locally, so CI caught it. "Your timer starts when the cards are ready" is
real reassurance and moved into the panel body under the title, where a sentence
fits; its test stands unchanged. The "Choose within" assertions were replaced
with the decision timer's ROLE, which is what they should have used: a countdown
is identified by role="timer" and its aria-label, not by wording a redesign can
legitimately change.

Draft polish:
- The compact panel's Confirm button appeared on selection, and since every
  button in that row is flex-1, inserting a third resized and re-wrapped Reroll
  and Bank the instant you clicked a card, moving the row under the cursor
  mid-click. Always rendered and merely disabled now, matching the full overlay.
- The lock-in bar transitioned width at 10Hz for the whole 20 second window,
  relayouting inside an overflow-hidden parent on every tick. Now scaleX.
- The wall torches were gated on reduced motion only, so twelve elements running
  ten infinite animations kept burning after useAmbientAutoCalm had measured the
  device as too slow, and when the player chose Calm by hand. They follow the FX
  dial now. Related: the panel's resize listener was keyed on dragPos, so
  dragging re-registered it on every pointermove.
- The most blocking surface in the product had no dialog semantics at all: a
  keyboard user tabbed straight out of a forced decision into the board. Now a
  labelled dialog with focus contained, pulled in on open (only when focus is
  outside) and restored on close. Escape peeks at the board, matching the Hide
  button, rather than closing: a draft cannot be dismissed.
- The reduced-motion notice added last session could render over the draft
  cards. It queues through the UI interrupt slot, but that only defers to holds
  that already exist and its effect runs on mount, before the opening draft has
  pushed one. It now waits before asking for a slot.

Clock rebalance, tier 1: 13 cards down to 2. Kept Polite Cough and Pinch of Sand,
where time IS the card. Eight were pure riders on cards already complete without
them. Three had the clock as their actual payoff and got a board payoff instead:
Loyal Pawn (the early promotion arrives protected for a turn), Quiet March (the
retreating pawn cannot be captured next turn), Name Tag (whichever piece takes
Gary walks away clean). augmentThenResolve now passes the resolving move to its
callback, which is what lets the first two shield the square the piece landed on.
Doing this one card at a time was the right call: two of eleven turned out to be
the card's entire payoff rather than a rider, and a regex would have gutted them.

Exploit sweep over resource-granting hooks: bn4_relay_baton granted a draft
reroll and 8 seconds on EVERY castle or promotion after the first, uncapped and
never spent. Promotions repeat, and with a revive or summon card indefinitely, so
a tempo card was an unbounded draft-manipulation engine. Capped at two later
handoffs. Other flagged candidates were false positives bounded by spendOnVia.

Mobile leaderboard, rendered at 360x808 with a stubbed API (the dev database has
no rated games, so the podium never mounts locally): every podium name was
truncated to a stub on ~100px risers, the champion's games count wrapped while
its neighbours did not so the columns misaligned, and the table's W/L/D column
took 84px of a 336px row leaving names ~144px. Names now wrap instead of
truncating, the count is nowrap, and W/L/D hides below sm where the full record
is a tap away on the profile.

Verified: tsc, eslint, full battery, and all 26 Playwright e2e tests green.

Still outstanding: clock tiers 2 to 8 (99 cards), confusing-text simplification,
weak-card buffs, cosmetic-only cards, the UI transition-token sweep, and
AnimatePresence on the draft's unmount paths.

## 2026-08-03 09:26 EDT

Card animations now default ON even when the device asks apps to reduce motion.

- "Follow system motion" flips to default OFF: card plays are gameplay
  information (they are how you see what a card just did), so the OS
  prefers-reduced-motion flag no longer stands them down unless the player
  opts in. The in-app Reduced motion and Animations switches keep working
  exactly as before and always win.
- MotionNotice grows a second variant. On a reduced-motion device with the new
  default, a one-time notice explains that effects are on by default and offers
  to turn them off, labelled not recommended since quiet plays are easy to
  miss ("Turn them off" sets followSystemMotion back on). Players who already
  opted in (or carry the old stored default) still get the original
  "Card effects are off" notice offering to show them anyway. Same UI interrupt
  queue as before, so neither variant can cover a draft.
- detectReduced (lib/useReducedMotion) now treats a stamped html[data-anim] as
  authoritative and only consults the OS media query pre-stamp, gated on the
  followSystemMotion setting. Before this, framer-motion driven effects stood
  down on OS reduced motion even with the setting off, the half-animated state
  the module's own docs warn about.
- The raw @media (prefers-reduced-motion) CSS guards in globals.css,
  DraftOverlay.css, creatorPlays.css and passive/primitives.css re-key onto
  html[data-anim="off"], which absorbs the OS request only when the player
  opted in; otherwise those keyframes would stay frozen while everything else
  played. draft-expire-pulse gains the data-anim rule it was missing.
- Settings hints for "Follow system motion" (Interface and Accessibility) now
  say it is off by default and that turning it on is not recommended.

check-buttons all green. PR #463. OPEN.

Animation quality pass on the three entrance systems the owner flagged as
basic. PR #463. OPEN.

- Nerf entrances: the category arrival is now a 9-layer verdict stamp
  (warning under-glow and judicial seal tell, two-part stamp head with a
  one-frame squash, ink shards, emboss afterglow, drips and flecks). The
  neutral floor most nerf cards resolve to is now an edict: parchment
  unrolls, sigil brands in with a scorch flash, wax seal punches, embers
  settle. The board nerf-reveal gains a descending tier-tinted sweep, a
  real slam on the stamp caption, and a staggered press cascade across
  affected squares inside the same 2s budget.
- Creator cards: the one shared ring-and-step-in entrance is gone; each of
  the five cards arrives as its play in miniature (bait tips over and
  SPROINGs out of the snare; the rook slams in behind streaks with its
  caption; lamp blooms and cards flip for family night; the stopwatch
  sprints in and skids with a green split; chat lines scroll and the
  picker ring rattles before locking).
- Passive spawns: every activation now announces itself with a tell
  (color under-bloom plus anchor inhale), an announce ring with rising
  motes, and a slow settle, fitted inside each visual's existing duration
  budget; the nerf reveal press gains a pre-press shadow, a held squash,
  and a release shockwave.

All three-beat, transform/opacity only, --fx-dur scaled, standing down
under html[data-anim="off"]. Verified: tsc, test:animations,

  travel by the stated time instead of creeping. applyUiPrefs stamps
  --piece-anim-ms; the board reads it when it starts a slide.
- Move-risk dots compute in an idle callback (useDeferredMoveRisks) instead of
  inside the render that lands the opponent's move, so that frame paints
  before 30 to 80 makeMove calls run.
- The check highlight reads the optimistic board, so the enemy king turns red
  when your piece lands, not one round trip later.
- A move played during a socket blip is held and flushed on reconnect
  (multiplayer.sendMove) instead of being dropped with an error toast.
- New Lichess prefs: Tenths of seconds (never / under 10s / always), Material
  difference, Show ratings.

Draft:
- The treasure chest is gone. DraftVault is a CSS 3D six-sided sigil prism
  over counter-rotating rune rings; materials slate / iron / gilt / arcane /
  apex / mythic climb with the offer's best card. Opening (~920ms): spin-up,
  rings flare and lift, faces shear away, core blooms into a flash and
  shockwave, cards deal out of the light. Same contract, same reduced-motion
  handling, /dev/chest gallery updated.
- When the 20s window ends the draft no longer auto-picks or vanishes, online
  or against a bot: it shrinks into the corner panel and STAYS there (the 12s
  auto-tuck fuse is gone) until the player resolves it. The bot game resumes
  the player's clock at that point. e2e draft-timing updated accordingly.

Phone layout (Lichess column one):
- The match page scrolls on phones instead of clipping inside h-dvh. Board is
  full-bleed, player bars are ~2.75rem (name over material, never wrapping)
  with the clock beside them, and MobileMatchStack renders actions, a
  horizontal MoveStrip with prev/next, your rule, the buff dock inline, chat
  and stakes under the board. MobileMoveDrawer and MobileActionsMenu are
  removed; MobileBuffDrawer is tablet-only now. Headers are 44-48px on phones,
  chat and clock labels come up to 12px, corner overlays sit at the edge.

Loading:
- LockInCountdown split out of DraftOverlay so the corner notice no longer
  pulls the whole overlay and its stylesheet into first paint; PassiveLayer
  loads lazily; sound preload waits for an idle callback; framer-motion added
  to optimizePackageImports.

Bug sweep (see the PR for the file list): 15+10 friend preset broke the
custom slider, settings writes ran inside setState updaters, rematch button
could stay disabled forever, inbox failed silently, poll writes after unmount,
uncleared flash timers, friendBusy not reset across profiles, silent friend
refresh failures, wrong queue fallback pool, details/open desync, case
sensitive own-seek check, guest accounts minted on a transient auth blip,
leaked seek timers.

Verified: tsc, eslint, check battery (emdash, rounded, buttons, reduced-motion,
animations, anim-props, board3d, sound, treatments, usage, clock-format).

Redesign follow-up: defaults, premoves, dock, profile, search, balance pass

The default look is Lichess dark with the midnight board, premoves behave like Lichess, the dock has hotkeys and inline Use, the profile and search pages are fixed, and every card in play was re-priced against its own family. PR #482. OPEN. Bundle work in PR #483. OPEN.

Defaults:
- The site theme default goes back to Lichess dark; the board default is the dark grey-blue midnight set. The navy Midnight site theme stays as an option.

Draft and moves:
- The vault's rings and caps burn in the exact tier colour of the best card inside, the caption carries the tier numeral, and tier 9/10 cards get their own deal-glow rows (they fell back to brass before).
- Premoves are Lichess-exact: one slot, a new premove replaces it, and any click or refused drop that is not a premove cancels it.
- The dock flips between You and Them with y / t (shared across every mounted dock), and a collapsed row keeps its Use button.

Pages:
- Profile games tab: stat tiles, one labelled filter row, 48px grid rows; clubs are plain accent links.
- Hero TV frame is token-only, so no black halo on light and no doubled edge on dark.
- Friends list shows 12 with Show all, presence computed once, an overflow menu on narrow rails.
- Find a player: the search route ranked prefix matches only after a 50-row window that house accounts filled, so real players never appeared; it now ranks first, excludes house accounts, and the dropdown reopens on focus and retype.
- Codex lists only cards in play and no longer says Showing N of M; the show-retired toggle is gone.
- The Updates wall is generated from this changelog (`npm run gen:updates`, guarded by `test:updates`), with hand-written entries kept on top.

Balance, full pass: 334 tier moves through hand-audit.json, three reworks (Warp Home free action, Hard Reset freeze fallback, Lifebloom to rank 4 under a shield), 14 text rewrites, five retirements; ladder invariants pinned in `test:balance-pass`. Details in docs/overhaul-checklist.md.

Bundle (PR #483): the 1,539-icon lucide map loads on demand behind the category ring fallback; combo tags moved to a leaf module. Match routes drop from 1,539 statically reachable icons to 159.

Round three: worker, engine and match-flow bug fixes

A second sweep over the areas the first two passes skipped: the game server's clock and rematch paths, the engine's chained-move guard and notation, and the match page's reconnect and draft flows. PR #484. OPEN.

Server and sync:
- A disconnect pause taken during a move or a draft deadline is billed again: both resume paths now check the live pause before restarting the clock, the same way draft actions did.
- Rematch requests claim the slot before any database await, so a double tap makes one rematch game and a cancel during the await is not lost; the cancel frame carries the canceller's colour so only the other side's offer resets.
- Aborting a game re-reads the match after the abort-history await, so a game that ended in between is not aborted twice.
- A resync clears the in-flight connect handle, so a reconnect no longer waits out the full eight-second fail timer.
- A move buffered during a disconnect is dropped along with any premove when the board rolls back, and sending now reports sent, held or failed so the optimistic board is only kept on sent.

Engine:
- A free action that grants no extra move (Warp Home) no longer arms the chained-move king guard, so the activator's own king capture stays legal. Covered in `test:balance-pass`.
- Move numbers no longer double-increment on two consecutive Black moves. Covered in `test:san`.
- Move-risk lookups key on castle and drop as well as from/to, so a castling move and a king step to the same square no longer share a risk badge.

Match page and settings:
- Settings pulled from the server are validated before they touch local storage, and pushes adopt the server's timestamp so a change no longer reverts on reload when the clocks disagree.
- The minimized draft panel has a Tuck control; its double-tap guard now measures real elapsed time. The phone move strip rests at the left edge when reviewing from the start of the line.
- Dock rows show one Use button, dragging a card with no target no longer fires it, and an expanded row stays open while a copy's countdown ticks.
- Analyze is hidden for card games (the analysis board would silently truncate them) and the analysis page says when a line stops early. Tournament pages clear a stale error on a successful load.

Checks: `test:retired` now enforces a floor of 12 cards per tier per mode; `test:glossary-effects` fails on an empty map.

Verified: tsc, eslint, the full check battery, Playwright (30 passed, 1 skipped).
