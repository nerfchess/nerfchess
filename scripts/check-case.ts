//   npx tsx scripts/check-case.ts            # report

//   npx tsx scripts/check-case.ts --strict   # fail on a NEW offender or a stale baseline entry
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// The design system is unusually specific here, in two places:
//
//   Section 11: "Sentence case everywhere, including buttons ('Find a match',
//   not 'FIND A MATCH'). Allcaps survive only in the LIVE badge."
//
//   Section 3: "The 9-10px letterspaced-smallcaps pattern is retired sitewide,
//   along with the .smallcaps / .eyebrow / .kicker utilities that carried it.
//   A section label is a plain bold heading at the body size, not an uppercase
//   tracked-out device." And: hierarchy is "weight + size + color, in that
//   order. Never letter-spacing alone."
//
// Both rules were written down and neither was enforced, so the device
// survived in the single most visible place on the site: the main nav, on
// every page, plus every section head in the quick-settings popover. It was
// not found by any guard. It was found by rendering a page and looking at it.
//
// The `.allcaps` utility is the reason a checker is worth more than a one-off
// cleanup. It had zero call sites and sat in globals.css anyway, which is
// exactly how a retired pattern returns: the next person reaches for the class
// that already exists and assumes it is sanctioned.
//
// WHAT COUNTS AS AN OFFENDER
//
// A Tailwind `uppercase` class or a CSS `text-transform: uppercase`, anywhere
// under src/ outside the exempt paths below. Tracking on its own is NOT
// flagged: `tracking-*` is legitimate on a mono clock or a logotype, and
// flagging it would bury the signal. The uppercase transform is the thing the
// document actually bans.
//
// THE BASELINE
//
// Same shape as scripts/check-buttons.ts, and for the same reason: the
// remaining sites are judgement calls that deserve a designer's eye rather
// than a blanket rewrite, and a guard that fails on all of them from day one
// gets disabled instead of obeyed. --strict fails on anything NEW, and also on
// a stale entry, so the list can only shrink.
//
// A baseline entry is a debt, not an exemption. The genuinely sanctioned case
// (the LIVE badge) is listed under EXEMPT with its reason.
