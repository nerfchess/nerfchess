// Route sweep.
//
// One test per public route. Each test loads that route across the full
// width x theme matrix and runs the checks that the design system (see
// docs/design-system.md) and the accessibility contract in section 10 make
// non-negotiable. It fixes nothing and asserts nothing at the end: the output
// is a DEFECT LIST, written to e2e/__screens__/sweep-report.json and printed
// as a summary, plus a full-page screenshot per cell so later rounds can diff.
//
// Why a sweep and not per-route specs: the failures this catches (a table that
// overflows at 360, a caption at 10px, a heading demoted to <h2> so a page has
// zero <h1>) are systemic. They come from shared components, so they repeat on
// dozens of routes and are invisible when you only ever look at one route at
// one width in one theme.
//
// Deliberately non-failing: a `expect()` per finding would stop the sweep at
// the first bad route and hide the other sixty. Findings accumulate; the last
// test in the file prints them and is the one that fails if you want a gate.
// Today it only reports, because this round is a survey.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// The matrix. Widths are the real breakpoints the app cares about: 360 is the
// small-Android floor, 390 the iPhone floor, 768 the tablet/`md` edge, 1024 the
// `lg` edge where the game rail appears, 1440 the design reference, 1920 the
// widest common desktop (where a max-width bug shows up as a stretched page).

// flag and the accent custom properties that applyUiPrefs also sets, so the

// straight out of the card libraries, so they resolve to prerendered pages.
// The account-shaped ones (/u, /clubs, /tournaments, /inbox) need a row in the

// user, a club and a tournament through the public API before it starts and

 * fixed to 44px-on-touch was still counted as a defect. Measured on one tree:
 * 258 findings at 360 with a fine pointer against 81 with a coarse one. The
 * design rule is "44px on a coarse pointer", so the fine number is not a
 * weaker version of the right answer, it is an answer to a different question,
 * and `sweep-baseline.json` encoded it.
 *
 * The pointer type is fixed when the CONTEXT is created (`hasTouch`), which is
 * why this needs its own page rather than a flag flipped mid-cell. CDP's
 * `Emulation.setEmulatedMedia` looks like it should do it and does not: with
 * `{name:"pointer", value:"coarse"}` sent, `matchMedia("(pointer: coarse)")`
 * still reports false, so a sweep built on it would have gone on reporting
 * fine-pointer numbers under a coarse-pointer label. Verified both ways before

// docs/design-system.md section 8 asks every async surface for five states:
// loading, empty, error, disconnected, recovered. Three of those are only
// visible when the backend misbehaves, which a sweep cannot arrange, so this
// reads the source instead: which route has a loading.tsx (its own or an
// inherited one), which imports EmptyState, which has an error branch, and
// which mounts ConnectionBanner. It is a work list, not a verdict.
