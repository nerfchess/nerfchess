          Nerf Chess is chess, until it isn&apos;t. Five house rules are everything you need to know.
          Everything else depends on your mode: in Nerf mode, your secret handicap and the hexes,
          boons, and items you draft; in Buff mode, the buff cards both players draft every 5 moves.
