// The shared body of every 404 on the site.
//
// It is the counterpart of components/ui/RouteError: the three halves of a
// designed missing-thing state (what is missing, in that thing's own words; why
// you might be here; a way onward that is never a dead end) authored once, so
// each `not-found.tsx` supplies only the sentence that is actually specific to
// it and cannot be got wrong twice.
//
// Deliberately a server component. Nothing here needs the client, and a 404 is
// the one page that must render when everything else has failed to; the root
// not-found is the only one that reaches for the client, and only because it
// has to read the path to know what was being looked for.
