// What each kind of missing thing is called, and what to offer instead.
//
// A 404 is a piece of copy, not a status code, and "Page not found" is the
// answer to a question nobody asked: the reader knows the page did not load,
// what they want to know is whether the PLAYER exists, whether the GAME is
// over, whether they mistyped the tournament link. So each family of URL gets
// its own words and its own way onward.
//
// Kept as data, and separate from the panel that renders it, so the root
// not-found (which picks a kind from the path) and a segment's own
// not-found.tsx (which knows its kind statically) say the identical thing.
