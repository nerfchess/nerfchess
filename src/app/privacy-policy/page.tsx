      <InfoSection title="Information we collect">
        <p>
          We collect only the information needed to operate the Service. When you
          create an account, we store your username, a cryptographically hashed
          version of your password (we never store or have access to your password
          itself), your account creation date, and your rating data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on how you use the Service, we may also store:

          <li>
            <strong className="text-parchment">Profile content</strong> you choose
            to add, such as a bio or profile picture. This content is displayed
            publicly on your player page.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-parchment">Gameplay data</strong>, including
            the moves, participants, time control, result, and rating changes of
            finished online games. This powers game history, replays, statistics,
            and the leaderboard.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-parchment">Communications</strong>, including
            direct messages you exchange with other players (along with read
            status), challenges you send, and notifications addressed to you.
            In-game chat is relayed live and is not generally retained; messages
            flagged by our automated profanity filter are kept for moderator
            review.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-parchment">Moderation records</strong>, such

            resulting moderation actions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not collect email addresses, real names, phone numbers, payment
          information, or precise location data. Creating an account requires only
          a username and password.

      <InfoSection title="Cookies and local storage">
        <p>
          We use a single essential cookie: an httpOnly session cookie that keeps
          you signed in to your account. It is set when you sign in and removed

          </li>
          <li>

      <InfoSection title="Data retention">
        <p>
          We retain your information for as long as your account is active or as
          needed to provide the Service. Completed game records are retained to
          preserve the integrity of ratings, statistics, and opponents&apos; game
          histories. Moderation records may be retained after account closure
          where necessary to keep the platform safe, such as to enforce bans.
        </p>
      </InfoSection>

      <InfoSection title="Security">
        <p>
          We take reasonable measures to protect your information. Passwords are
          stored only in hashed form, and connections to the Service are encrypted
          in transit using HTTPS. However, no method of transmission or storage is
          completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. Please use
          a strong, unique password for your account.

      <InfoSection title="Children's privacy">
        <p>
          The Service is not directed at children under the age of 13, and we do
          not knowingly collect personal information from them. Because accounts
          require only a username and password, we collect minimal information
          from all users. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with
          personal information, please contact us and we will remove it.
