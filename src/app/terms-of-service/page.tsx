          <li>
            Manipulate ratings, leaderboards, or results through collusion,

      <InfoSection title="Service availability">
        <p>
          The Service is provided as-is and as-available. Nerf Chess is a free,

          or punitive damages, or for any loss of data, ratings, progress, or
          goodwill, arising out of or related to your use of the Service. Because the
          Service is provided free of charge, our total liability for any claim
          relating to the Service is limited to the amount you paid to use it, which
          is zero. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations, so parts of
          this section may not apply to you.

          players, or put the Service at risk. Provisions that by their nature should

          limitation of liability, continue to apply after your access ends.

          above. Your continued use of the Service after changes take effect means
          you accept the updated Terms. If you do not agree to a change, please stop
          using the Service.
