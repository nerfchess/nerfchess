// The /settings screen.
//
// Settings used to exist only inside a modal opened from the header, which
// meant they had no address: you could not bookmark them, link a friend to the
// board-theme picker, or land on them from search. This is the same surface at
// a URL.
//
// It is NOT a second implementation. Every row, control and picker comes from
// components/settings/rows.tsx, and the rows themselves from
// components/settings/config.ts, the identical modules the panel renders. A row
// added to that config appears here and in the panel at once, and a change made
// on either surface reaches the other through SETTINGS_CHANGED_EVENT, which
// useSettingsModel subscribes to. There is nothing to keep in step by hand.
//
// DEEP LINKING is a real path segment: /settings/appearance, not a fragment.
// A path reaches the server, so the section gets its own <title> and canonical,
// an unknown one gets a real 404 through notFound(), and browser history moves
// between sections. The fragment form still works on this index page, every
// section is rendered here with id={section.id}, so /settings#appearance scrolls
// to it, but it is the weaker half of the pair: a fragment is invisible to the
// server, so it can never be more than a scroll position.
//
// The five system states (design-system.md §8), all real dependencies of this
// surface rather than states invented to fill a checklist:
//   1. Loading:      the stored values live in localStorage, which the server
//                     render cannot see, so the rows mount after hydration.
//   2. Empty:        the filter matched no setting.
//   3. Error:        this browser refuses to persist (private mode, blocked
//                     site data), so nothing changed here would survive.
//   4. Disconnected: the account sync endpoint is unreachable; changes still
//                     apply and still save locally, they just do not follow you.
//   5. Recovered:    the sync came back, announced once and then dismissed.
