// of /dev/effects (which covers the passive layer). Two views:
//
//  - The grid (no `id` in the URL): every live card's lead scene staged on
//    real boards at five probe squares, for scanning and anchoring checks.
//    Retired cards are left out: they can never be drafted, so reviewing
//    their art is wasted effort.
//  - The stage (`?id=<card>`, see stageParams.ts for every parameter): one
//    card played on the REAL Board, on the square, targets, side, speed and
//    --fx-dur the URL names, with the full choreography (cast spectacle,
//    lead, per-target cuts, canvas VFX). Scriptable through
//    window.__cardStage; scripts/polish/card-strip.ts drives it.
