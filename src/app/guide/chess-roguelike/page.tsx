          In{" "}

          power-ups you keep for yourself; in{" "}
          <Link href="/guide/nerf-mode" className="underline">Nerf mode</Link> they are mostly
          hexes you cast on your opponent, plus boons and items. The card layer sits on top of an
          ordinary chess game, so the pieces and the board are familiar, but the toolkit you build
          from the deck is different every match.

      <InfoSection title="Escalating power, like a run">
        <p>
          What gives Nerf Chess its roguelike feel is the escalation. Cards are graded into eight
          difficulty <Link href="/guide/glossary#tier" className="underline">tiers</Link>
          <GlossaryText text=", from I (Trivial) to VIII (Unhinged), and the draft climbs that curve as the game goes on — round by round the offers roll around tiers I, II, III, V, then VII. Early offers are mild; late-game offers can be board-warping. You can skip a draft to bank it and roll your next offer one tier higher, a timing gamble that rewards patience. The top tiers are deliberately rare (every level above VI can slip back down), and the legendary bands — apex at tier 9 and mythic at tier 10 — never roll in the normal draft at all: they must be earned, by banking a tier-8 offer, winning a Chess Diff, or gambling on a Jackpot." />

        <p>
          The card pool is large and browsable. Over 1,000 cards and rules, power-up buffs, secret

          text. If you like deckbuilders and drafting games, the draft is the part of Nerf Chess
          that will feel like home, even though there is no deck to build before the match: your
          &quot;deck&quot; is assembled live, one draft at a time.

      <InfoSection title="How it differs from a pure roguelike">
        <p>
          Nerf Chess is not a single-player run against escalating floors: it is a two-player game
          where both sides draft, and skill at reading the board and the cards decides it. What it
          shares with roguelikes and deckbuilders is the shape of the fun, drafting under
          uncertainty and adapting to what you draw, applied to a{" "}
