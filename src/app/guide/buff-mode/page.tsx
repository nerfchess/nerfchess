          <GlossaryText text="Instead of picking, you can skip a draft to bank it: your next offer rolls one tier higher. Banking never stacks beyond one tier, so the decision is a real gamble on timing rather than a snowball, with one jackpot case: bank an offer that contained a tier-8 card and your next offer becomes a guaranteed two-card apex (tier 9) offer, each slot with about a 10% chance to upgrade into a tier-10 mythic. You also start with one reroll, which swaps the offer for a fresh, guaranteed-different pair at the same tiers." />

Early drafts offer low tiers and the curve climbs round by round, roughly tiers I, II, III, V, then VII, with a small random wobble each round. The very top is gated: above tier VI every level has a 45% chance to slip back down one, so board-clearing, near-invincibility cards stay rare blowout moments instead of the default endgame." />{" "}

        <p>
          <GlossaryText text="A few engine rules keep Buff mode a chess game rather than pure chaos. Freezes and walnut hexes never affect kings, so the target of the game can always run. A shield never covers the king, and an uncapturable piece may never be the one that takes the enemy king: you must expose a piece to win. A player completely locked down by effects gets a forced pass instead of losing to &quot;no legal moves&quot;, and if both players are paralyzed the game is a draw." />{" "}
