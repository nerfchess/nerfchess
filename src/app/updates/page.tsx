      <p>
        The pool had grown to about 2,450 cards, and hundreds of them were the same idea with a
        different name, a strictly worse rung of another card, or a rule too long to read at the
        board. Those are now retired: they no longer come up in a draft, old games that used them
        still replay exactly, and the codex keeps their pages behind a &quot;Show retired&quot;
        filter with a pointer to the card that covers the same ground.
      </p>
    </>
  ),
  "new-look": (
    <p>
      The whole site sits on flat warm greys with square corners, metal buttons and a 60px top
      bar, laid out the way Lichess lays out a page. Boxes are boxes, links are blue, dates and
      ranks are brass, and nothing glows.
    </p>
  ),
  "hundreds-of-new-cards": (
    <>
      <p>
        Four themed sets joined the pool: elemental (fire, ice, storm, earth, tide, growth),
        warfare (charges, sieges, formations, reinforcements), arcane (teleports, time-stops,
        transmutation, meta effects), and chaos (slapstick and curses with a real bite). Every one
        reuses the engine&apos;s existing mechanics, and each is tuned to a tier that matches its
        real power. Browse the whole library in the{" "}

    </>
  ),
  "bigger-more-distinct-animations": (
    <p>
      Cards that used to share one look now each get their own. Freezes split into an ice-shatter,
      a chain-freeze, a deep glacier and a snap-frost; the petrify family got its own gorgon and
      stone looks; and the marquee cards, board-wipes, sieges, meteors and transforms all got
      dedicated spectacles. Every animation plays for both players and respects reduced motion.
    </p>
  ),
  "balance-and-clarity": (
    <p>
      A full re-audit corrected dozens of card tiers so that cards doing the same thing sit at the
      same tier, and descriptions were rewritten to say exactly what a card does, to whom, and for
      how long. Protection cards state whether your king is covered, and an uncapturable piece can
      no longer be the one that captures the enemy king.
    </p>
  ),
  "lobby-and-matches": (
    <p>
      House players are matched against each other so the lobby stays alive, you can see who is
      spectating your game, and a handful of match bugs were fixed, including a rare case where a
      house opponent could concede for no reason. New here? Start with{" "}
