// Editorial history for the codex card pages: when each card entered the
// game, plus curated per-card balance notes. Server-safe pure data (no React,
// no client APIs) so the card routes render it statically as crawlable HTML.
//
// Two layers:
// - WAVES: one "added" event per shipping wave, dated from the git history of
//   the card barrels and the PR numbers in docs/CHANGELOG.md. Every card maps
//   to a wave via resolveWave, so every page has at least one history line.
// - CARD_HISTORY: hand-curated per-card events (tier moves, reworks) keyed
//   "buff:<id>" / "nerf:<id>". Starts sparse; grows as balance changes ship.
//
// Runtime moderator changes (card_overrides edits) are NOT here: those are
// recorded in the card_override_history table and merged in client-side by
// the CardInsights panel.
