// Funny set: SUMMONS & REINFORCEMENTS. Most cards grant a piece to your
// crazyhouse-style pocket (grantInventory, a free instant): you draft it now
// and spend a later turn to DROP it, so the summon itself costs no move. The
// rest reuse summonTemp (a rental that expires), lineSweep (a charging piece),
// or a conditional passive modeled on the library's trade_up / insurance
// pattern. The engine's drop generator already refuses to drop a pawn on rank
// 1 or 8, and a king is never bankable.
