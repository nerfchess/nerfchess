// Fantasy set: HEROES & LEGENDS. Songs of named champions: a dragonslayer's
// single killing stroke (removeEnemies), the knights of the round table riding
// to your banner (grantInventory), a shieldmaiden's guard (shield), the call to
// adventure that widens your next draft (draft flags), a giant's maul swung
// down a file (lineSweep), a riddle in the dark that wastes the enemy's turn
// (skipOpponent), a valkyrie carrying your fallen champion home (reviveOne),
// the hero who holds the bridge (king_safe), a pawn with a sling (charged
// augment), a dragon broken to the saddle (pieceBound), the legendary forge
// (transformOwn), and a closing age of heroes (timedAugment). Every card
// reuses an existing primitive; kings are never removed or frozen, and
// movement grants only ever widen a move list, so nothing can soft-lock.
