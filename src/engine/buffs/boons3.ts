// Boon wave 3 - the 2026-07 top-tier boon expansion. Boons are the rarer,
// stranger, more transformative side of the draft pool: miracles, contracts,
// rare transformations, comeback engines, conditional wards - never just
// bigger numbers. Every card here carries `boon: true` so it joins nerf
// mode's boon/item bucket, plus a normal BuffCategory for codex grouping.
// Spread into ALL_BUFFS by library.ts; ids are all prefixed `bw3_` and must
// not collide with existing cards.
//
// Design notes (mechanics survey, tier ladder, family coverage, cut designs):
// docs/2026-07-17-boon-wave3-design.md. Authoritative brief:
// docs/2026-07-17-wave3-content-map.md. Prior batch idiom: boons2.ts.
//
// Every mechanic below rides EXISTING engine rails only: ActiveEffect kinds,
// DraftFlags, the BuffApi mutators, augmentMoves / filterOpponentMoves /
// onMovePlayed, the revive pools, the crazyhouse pocket and the clock intent.
// No randomness is drawn here at all (every wave-3 boon is a pure read of the
// synced board or a deterministic mutation), so every replica replays the
// identical outcome. Kings are never frozen, walnutted, removed, transformed
// or bound; king safety is only ever the sanctioned `king_safe` effect or an
// added king MOVE (the Cornered King / Bolt Hole precedent), never a capture
// filter (which would break check detection and soft-lock the game).
//
// Import paths are relative (not the "@/" alias): tsconfig.server.json does
// not resolve the alias, and the engine must build for the server tests.
