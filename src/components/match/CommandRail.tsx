// The command rail: the framed left column of a game screen (mode header,
// opponent, the dock and chat, you), as one component instead of two.
//
// It existed twice — once in OnlineMatch and once in the bot game — as ~100
// lines of near-identical JSX that had drifted: the online copy grew a collapse
// control, a luxe material, a rating-stakes footer and a breathing halo on the
// charged player's card, and the bot copy grew a "Plain chess" mode the online
// one cannot have. Two copies is a maintenance cost at the best of times; it is
// a worse one now, because a theme that restyles the rail has to be checked in
// two places and a drift between them reads as a bug in the theme.
//
// The API is SLOTS, NOT DATA. This component never receives `game`, `myColor`
// or `start` — the caller passes rendered cards in. That is what lets one
// component absorb both callers without becoming a union of two prop sets, and
// it keeps the rail a layout surface rather than a second place that knows the
// rules of the game.
//
// Rail WIDTH deliberately stays with the callers. --match-rail-w is not only
// this column's width: it feeds the board-sizing min() math in both parents, so
// owning it here would split one calculation across two files.
