//     live elapsed-seconds counter;
//   - once it comes back: "Reconnected" for three seconds, then it dismisses
//     itself.
// The confirmation only appears after an actual drop, so the initial connect
// never flashes a spurious "Reconnected". aria-live is polite and the only
// motion (the lost-state dot pulse) is gated behind motion-safe.
//
// Two entry points, one behaviour. The signal source differs by surface, the
// pill does not:
//   <ConnectionBanner session={…} />       a socket, on the game and TV surfaces
//   <PollConnectionBanner healthy={…} />   a repeating poll, on /inbox/[username]
// Anything without a repeating or persistent connection is NOT a customer for
// this: a route that fetches once is owed the error state (§8.3), where the
// recovery is the reader pressing Retry, not a banner narrating a socket.
