// The top bar every route skeleton opens with.
//
// Eight route skeletons had each hand-copied this block, and they had drifted:
// three different `borderRadius` inline styles (1, 2, and none) that all lose
// to the `!important` geometry rule in globals.css anyway, and one copy still
// wearing a `border-white/5` alpha hairline that the colour table (design
// system section 2) retired in favour of `--edge`. One component, one bar.
//
// It is deliberately NOT the real SiteHeader: that one fetches the session,
// challenges, and notifications on mount, and rendering it inside a loading
// fallback would fire all three a second time only to throw the result away.
// A skeleton stands in for the header with SiteHeader's own box: the same
// min-height (48px on phones, 60px from `sm`, border included), gaps and side
// padding, and no vertical padding. It used to add py-3 around its 28px
// blocks, which made it 50px on a phone against the real header's 48, so
// every route skeleton sat 2px low and jumped when the page swapped in.
