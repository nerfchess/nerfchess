// The one button.
//
// Buttons carried their material in a global .btn-* class and their geometry in
// a Tailwind string copy-pasted at every call-site, which meant the shape of a
// button was a convention rather than a thing.
//
// Both halves now live here. The material is gone: a button is a flat box in
// one of three roles.
//
//   primary  solid accent fill, white label. One per view region.
//   default  raised surface with a hairline border. Everything else.
//   danger   the same shape carrying red. Resign, delete, leave, decline.
//
// The older tone names (leaf, cta, gold, glass, slab, ghost, quiet) are kept as
// aliases onto those three so no call-site had to be rewritten. They no longer
// select different materials, only the role they always meant.
