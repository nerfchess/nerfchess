// The shared body of every route-level error boundary.
//
// Design system section 8 spells out what an error state owes the player: what
// failed in plain words, a Retry, and a way out. Never a dead end. The three
// halves are easy to get wrong once per route, so they are authored once here
// and each `error.tsx` supplies only the sentence that is actually specific to
// it ("The leaderboard could not load"), which is the part a generic boundary
// can never say.
//
// Retry is wired to Next's `retry()`, not `reset()`. `reset()` re-renders the
// boundary's children with whatever it already has; `retry()` re-fetches them
// first, which is what a player pressing a button labelled Retry means. Both
// props are passed to an error component (next 16.3; `retry` went stable in
// 16.3.0), and the root boundary still uses `reset` because it sits above the
// data.
//
// No SiteHeader here on purpose: the nav is rendered by each page rather than
// by a layout, so a failed segment has no shell to keep, and the header does
// its own fetching (session, challenges, notifications) which may be exactly
// what just broke. The way-out link carries the navigation instead.
