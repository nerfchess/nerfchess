            For a seated player in a game where both sides carried a rule, this
            is the payoff of the entire mode, and it gets the panel rather than
            a row inside a fold. Three things changed and each one had a reason:

            it is no longer folded, because a beat behind a disclosure is a beat
            most players never see (and, as a previous round measured, one that
            can run to `finished` inside the closed <details> while nobody is
            looking — a hazard that simply cannot exist out here);

            the opponent's card comes up under a LID rather than appearing, so
            there is a sealed thing on screen before there is a revealed one,
            which is the whole difference between a reveal and a render;

            and the lid is an overlay on the finished card, so the panel is its
            final height from the first frame and nothing under it moves.

            The rules still print in full: no truncation, no tooltip. */}
