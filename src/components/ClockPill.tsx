            Lichess does this and it reads as decoration there; here it
            carries real information, because this clock genuinely stops. A
            draft pauses it, the first-move grace shields it, and a paused
            clock and a running one otherwise look identical for the whole
            second between digit changes. A player glancing down needs to know
            whether their time is going.

            Split rather than restyled so `formatClock` keeps returning one
            plain string (scripts/test-clock-format.ts asserts on it). The
            colon stays in the accessible text rather than being aria-hidden:
            hiding it would leave a screen reader reading "205" for 2:05.
            Ambient loops are otherwise banned by design-system.md section 6;
            clock urgency is the sanctioned exception. */}
