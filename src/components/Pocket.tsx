 * the board then highlights every square where that drop is legal (via the
 * shared pickSquares plumbing). Renders nothing when the pocket is empty.
 *
 * The tray is authoritative: it always paints the ACTUAL piece each inventory
 * slot holds, never a masked or face-down placeholder. The inventory is a
 * per-seat synced record of real piece types, so any entry that is not a real
 * droppable piece (a stray masked value, a zero count, a king) is filtered out
 * rather than shown as a "hidden card". A held pocket piece therefore always
 * reads as exactly the piece you will drop.
 *
 * Look: 1px corners, no gradients/glow/shadow. Mint marks the armed /
 * actionable piece; the count chip rides in coral so it reads at a glance.
