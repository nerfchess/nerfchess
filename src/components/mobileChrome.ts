// Geometry of the fixed bottom chrome on the match surfaces, in one place.
//
// Both match views (OnlineMatch and the local /game page) render one
// position:fixed drawer bar below the board on tablet widths only:
//
//   MobileBuffDrawer   `sm:block lg:hidden` — bottom: 0, bar 2.75rem + safe area
//
// Below sm there is no fixed chrome at all: the page scrolls and everything
// stacks under the board (MobileMatchStack).
//
// The match column is `h-dvh` + `overflow-hidden`, so anything it fails to
// reserve room for is not scrollable-to — it is simply hidden behind the bars.
// It used to hardcode `pb-14` (56px) against as much as 88px of chrome, which
// buried the bottom player row, the rating strip, and the game-actions
// trigger — the only route to Draw/Resign/Takeback on a phone.
//
// The class strings below are written out IN FULL, never assembled from parts:
// Tailwind's JIT scans source text for literal class names, so an interpolated
// arbitrary value would simply never be generated.
