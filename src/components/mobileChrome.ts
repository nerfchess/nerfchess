//   MobileBuffDrawer   `sm:block lg:hidden`, bottom: 0, bar 46px + safe area
//
// Below sm there is no fixed chrome at all: the page scrolls and everything
// stacks under the board (MobileMatchStack). A portrait tablet is on that same
// column now (matchLayout.ts) and so has no fixed chrome either; the drawer is
// left to the sm..lg LANDSCAPE range that still puts a rail beside the board.
//
// The match column is `h-dvh` + `overflow-hidden`, so anything it fails to
// reserve room for is not scrollable-to, it is simply hidden behind the bars.
// It used to hardcode `pb-14` (56px) against as much as 88px of chrome, which
// buried the bottom player row, the rating strip, and the game-actions
// trigger, the only route to Draw/Resign/Takeback on a phone.
//
// The class strings below are written out IN FULL, never assembled from parts:
// Tailwind's JIT scans source text for literal class names, so an interpolated
// arbitrary value would simply never be generated.
