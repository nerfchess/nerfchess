/**
 * The player's Animations setting, as a tempo the JS-driven choreographies can
 * actually use.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * `html[data-anim]` carries three values (normal / fast / off) and globals.css
 * acts on two of them: "off" clamps every transition and animation to nothing,
 * and "fast" clamps `transition-duration` to 80ms. Neither touches a
 * `@keyframes` duration, a framer-motion transition, or a `setTimeout` — which
 * is the whole of the draft's choreography. So a player who explicitly asked
 * for fast animations still sat through the identical 2.8 second sealed-vault,
 * vault-opening and card-deal sequence as everyone else. "Fast" was a promise
 * the most expensive moment in the product did not keep.
 *
 * `useReducedMotion` already collapses the "off" case for us, so this hook
 * exists for the middle rung: it reports the tempo, and `tempoScale` turns it
 * into the multiplier a choreography applies to its own beats.
 *
 * Live in both directions (MutationObserver on the attribute), same as
 * useReducedMotion, so flipping the setting mid-session takes effect at once.
