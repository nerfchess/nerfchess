// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The eval bar, and the one honest thing it is allowed to say.
//
// `analyzeBoard` (engine/ai.ts) searches a bare BoardState. It knows the pieces,
// it knows that the game ends when a king is captured (its terminal test is a
// missing king, not checkmate), and that is the entire list. It does not know
// about nerfs, buffs, pocket drops, walls, frozen squares, or any of the other
// rules that decide most games on this site. A nerf that forbids a player from
// moving their queen does not exist as far as the search is concerned: it will
// happily build a principal variation out of moves that player cannot legally
// make, and then report the result to two significant figures.
//
// So the number is the eval of a DIFFERENT GAME than the one on screen, and the
// dishonesty is not the number's sign, it is its precision. "+2.3" claims to
// have resolved a position to a fifth of a pawn. On a board where a rule is
// live, that claim is not earned.
//
// The rule this file enforces:
//
//   * No rules in play  -> the position really IS plain chess. Show the signed
//     number, smooth bar, best move, depth. This is the analysis board.
//
//   * Any rule in play  -> the reading is an ESTIMATE of the plain-chess
//     skeleton underneath. The bar quantises to seven bands, the readout is a
//     word rather than a number, and the caption names the specific rules the
//     estimate is blind to. A word cannot be over-read the way "+2.3" can.
//
// The second mode deliberately does not hide the bar. Material and king safety
// are real, they survive the rules, and a player reviewing a game is better off
// with a coarse true statement than with nothing. What they must never get is a
// precise false one.
//
// Scheduling: the search runs in a worker (src/workers/evalWorker.ts), so it
// costs the page no frames at all. It still climbs a ladder of budgets, but for
// a different reason than it used to, a rough reading in 15ms and a good one a
// third of a second later beats one reading that arrives late, rather than as
// a way of slicing an unaffordable main-thread block into affordable pieces.
//
// Browsers without workers (and SSR) fall back to the old idle-callback ladder,
// with every rung clamped to MAIN_THREAD_RUNG_CAP_MS so the fallback stays
// frame-safe. It reads a shallower position; that is the price of not having a
// thread to put the work on, and it is paid where it belongs.
//
// Budgets below are TRUE wall times. They used to be halves: negamax aborted at
// `budget * 2`, so this file's old ladder cost about twice what it said and
// /analysis's original `analyzeBoard(board, 300)` was a 601ms block. The abort
// is now the number the caller asked for (see engine/ai.ts).
