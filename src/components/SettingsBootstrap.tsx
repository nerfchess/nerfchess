 *  The "effectsOn" variant surfaces that choice to affected players and offers
 *  the opt-out (stand effects down with the system), flagged as not
 *  recommended because quiet plays are easy to miss.
 *
 *  The "effectsOff" variant covers players who HAVE opted in (or carry the old
 *  stored default): applyUiPrefs folds the OS flag into html[data-anim="off"],
 *  a hard kill switch, which is indistinguishable from the game being broken —
 *  phones enable reduced motion for battery saving and accessibility defaults,
 *  so nothing would ever animate with nothing explaining it. This variant says
 *  why, and offers to show the effects anyway.
 *
 *  Either way it only appears when the OS request is the deciding factor: a
 *  player who turned on Reduced motion in Settings themselves knows exactly
 *  why it is quiet and is never interrupted. Goes through the same UI
 *  interrupt queue as LagWatch, so it can never cover a draft. */
